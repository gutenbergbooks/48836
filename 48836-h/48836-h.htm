The Marine Assault of Tarawa</h2>

<p class="p0 in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Colonel Joseph H. Alexander, USMC (Ret)</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> August 1943, to meet
in secret with Major
General Julian C.
Smith and his principal
staff officers of the 2d
Marine Division, Vice Admiral Raymond
A. Spruance, commanding the
Central Pacific Force, flew to New
Zealand from Pearl Harbor. Spruance
told the Marines to prepare for
an amphibious assault against
Japanese positions in the Gilbert Islands
in November.</p>

<p>The Marines knew about the Gilberts.
The 2d Raider Battalion under
Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson
had attacked Makin Atoll a year
earlier. Subsequent intelligence
reports warned that the Japanese had
fortified Betio Island in Tarawa Atoll,
where elite forces guarded a new
bomber strip. Spruance said Betio
would be the prime target for the 2d
Marine Division.</p>

<p>General Smith’s operations officer,
Lieutenant Colonel David M. Shoup,
studied the primitive chart of Betio
and saw that the tiny island was surrounded
by a barrier reef. Shoup
asked Spruance if any of the Navy’s
experimental, shallow-draft, plastic
boats could be provided. “Not available,”
replied the admiral, “expect
only the usual wooden landing craft.”
Shoup frowned. General Smith could
sense that Shoup’s gifted mind was
already formulating a plan.</p>

<p>The results of that plan were
momentous. The Tarawa operation
became a tactical watershed: the first,
large-scale test of American amphibious
doctrine against a strongly fortified
beachhead. The Marine assault
on Betio was particularly bloody. Ten
days after the assault, <i>Time</i> magazine
published the first of many post-battle
analyses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last week some 2,000 or
3,000 United States Marines,
most of them now dead or
wounded, gave the nation a
name to stand beside those of
Concord Bridge, the <i>Bon
Homme Richard</i>, the Alamo,
Little Big Horn and Belleau
Wood. The name was “Tarawa.”</p></blockquote>



<hr />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Setting_the_Stage" id="Setting_the_Stage"></a><i>Setting the Stage</i></h2>


<p>The Gilbert Islands consist of 16
scattered atolls lying along the equator
in the Central Pacific. Tarawa
Atoll is 2,085 miles southwest of
Pearl Harbor and 540 miles southeast
of Kwajalein in the Marshalls. Betio
is the principal island in the atoll.</p>

<p>The Japanese seized Tarawa and
Makin from the British within the
first three days after Pearl Harbor.
Carlson’s brief raid in August 1942
caused the Japanese to realize their
vulnerability in the Gilberts. Shortly
after the raid, the <i>6th Yokosuka
Special Naval Landing Force</i> arrived
in the islands. With them came Rear
Admiral Tomanari Saichiro, a superb
engineer, who directed the construction
of sophisticated defensive positions
on Betio. Saichiro’s primary
goal was to make Betio so formidable
that an American assault would
be stalled at the water’s edge, allowing
time for the other elements of the
<i>Yogaki</i> (“Waylaying Attack”) Plan to
destroy the landing force.</p>

<p>The <i>Yogaki</i> Plan was the Japanese
strategy to defend eastern Micronesia
from an Allied invasion. Japanese
commanders agreed to counterattack
with bombers, submarines, and the
main battle fleet. Admiral Chester W.
Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific
Fleet/Commander in Chief, Pacific
Ocean Areas (CinCPac/CinCPOA),
took these capabilities seriously.
Nimitz directed Spruance to “get the
hell in and get the hell out!” Spruance
in turn warned his subordinates to
seize the target islands in the Gilberts
“with lightning speed.” This sense of
urgency had a major influence on the
Tarawa campaign.</p>

<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned
the code name Galvanic to the campaign
to capture Tarawa, Makin, and
Apamama in the Gilberts. The 2d
Marine Division was assigned Tarawa
and Apamama (a company-sized
operation); the Army’s 165th
Regimental Combat Team of the 27th
Infantry Division would tackle
Makin.</p>

<p>By coincidence, each of the three
landing force commanders in Operation
Galvanic was a major general
named Smith. The senior of these
was a Marine, Holland M. “Howling
Mad” Smith, commanding V Amphibious
Corps. Julian C. Smith
commanded the 2d Marine Division.
Army Major General Ralph C. Smith
commanded the 27th Infantry Division.</p>

<p>Spruance assigned Rear Admiral
Richmond Kelly “Terrible” Turner,
veteran of the Guadalcanal campaign,
to command all amphibious
forces for the operation. Turner, accompanied
by Holland Smith, decided
to command the northern group,
Task Force 52, for the assault on
Makin. Turner assigned Rear Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Harry W. “Handsome Harry”
Hill to command the southern group,
Task Force 53, for the assault on
Tarawa. Julian Smith would accompany
Hill on board the old battleship
USS <i>Maryland</i> (BB 46). The two
officers were opposites&mdash;Hill, outspoken
and impetuous; Julian Smith,
reserved and reflective&mdash;but they
worked together well. Spruance set
D-Day for 20 November 1943.</p>

<p>Colonel Shoup came up with an
idea of how to tackle Betio’s barrier
reefs. He had observed the Marines’
new Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT
or “Alligator”), an amphibian tractor,
in operation during Guadalcanal.
The Alligators were unarmored logistic
vehicles, not assault craft, but
they were true amphibians, capable
of being launched at sea and swimming
ashore through moderate surf.</p>

<p>Shoup discussed the potential use
of LVTs as assault craft with Major
Henry C. Drewes, commanding the
2d Amphibian Tractor Battalion.
Drewes liked the idea, but warned
Shoup that many of his vehicles were
in poor condition after the Guadalcanal
campaign. At best, Drewes
could provide a maximum of 75 vehicles,
not nearly enough to carry the
entire assault and following waves.
Further, the thin hulls of the vehicles
were vulnerable to every enemy
weapon and would require some
form of jury-rigged armor plating for
minimal protection. Shoup encouraged
Drewes to modify the vehicles
with whatever armor plate he
could scrounge.</p>

<p>General Julian Smith was aware
that a number of LVT-2s were stockpiled
in San Diego, and he submitted
an urgent request for 100 of the
newer models to the corps commander.
Holland Smith endorsed the
request favorably, but Admiral Turner
disagreed. The two strong-willed
officers were doctrinally equal during
the planning phase, and the argument
was intense. While Turner
did not dispute the Marines’ need for
a reef-crossing capability, he objected
to the fact that the new vehicles
would have to be carried to Tarawa
in tank landing ships (LSTs). The
slow speed of the LSTs (8.5 knots
max) would require a separate convoy,
additional escorts, and an increased
risk of losing the element of
strategic surprise. Holland Smith
reduced the debate to bare essentials:
“No LVTs, no operation.” Turner acquiesced,
but it was not a complete
victory for the Marines. Half of the
100 new LVT-2s would go to the
Army forces landing at Makin
against much lighter opposition. The
50 Marine vehicles would not arrive
in time for either work-up training
or the rehearsal landings. The first
time the infantry would lay eyes on
the LVT-2s would be in the pre-dawn
hours of D-Day at Tarawa&mdash;if then.</p>

<h2><a name="Assault_Preparations" id="Assault_Preparations"></a><i>Assault Preparations</i></h2>


<p>As replacement troops began to
pour into New Zealand, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Smith requested the assignment of
Colonel Merritt A. “Red Mike” Edson
as division chief of staff. The
fiery Edson, already a legend in the
Corps for his heroic exploits in Central
America and Guadalcanal,
worked tirelessly to forge the amalgam
of veterans and newcomers into
an effective amphibious team.</p>

<p>Intelligence reports from Betio
were sobering. The island, devoid of
natural defilade positions and narrow
enough to limit maneuver room,
favored the defenders. Betio was less
than three miles long, no broader
than 800 yards at its widest point and
contained no natural elevation higher
than 10 feet above sea level. “Every
place on the island can be covered by
direct rifle and machine gun fire,” observed
Edson.</p>

<p>The elaborate defenses prepared
by Admiral Saichiro were impressive.
Concrete and steel tetrahedrons,
minefields, and long strings of
double-apron barbed wire protected
beach approaches. The Japanese also
built a barrier wall of logs and coral
around much of the island. Tank
traps protected heavily fortified command
bunkers and firing positions
inland from the beach. And everywhere
there were pillboxes, nearly
500 of them, most fully covered by
logs, steel plates and sand.</p>

<p>The Japanese on Betio were
equipped with eight-inch, turret-mounted
naval rifles (the so-called
“Singapore Guns”), as well as a large
number of heavy-caliber coast
defense, antiaircraft, antiboat, and
field artillery guns and howitzers.
Dual-purpose 13mm heavy machine
guns were prevalent. Light tanks
(mounting 37mm guns), 50mm “knee
mortars,” and an abundance of
7.7mm light machine guns complemented
the defensive weaponry.</p>

<p>The Japanese during August
replaced Saichiro with Rear Admiral
Meichi Shibasaki, an officer reputed
to be more of a fighter than an engineer.
American intelligence sources
estimated the total strength of the Betio
garrison to be 4,800 men, of
whom some 2,600 were considered
first-rate naval troops. “Imperial
Japanese Marines,” Edson told the
war correspondents, “the best Tojo’s
got.” Edson’s 1st Raider Battalion had
sustained 88 casualties in wresting
Tulagi from the <i>3d Kure Special
Naval Landing Force</i> the previous
August.</p>

<p>Admiral Shibasaki boasted to his
troops, “a million Americans couldn’t
take Tarawa in 100 years.” His optimism
was forgivable. The island was
the most heavily defended atoll that
ever would be invaded by Allied
forces in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Task Force 53 sorely needed
detailed tidal information for Tarawa.
Colonel Shoup was confident
that the LVTs could negotiate the reef
at any tide, but he worried about the
remainder of the assault troops,
tanks, artillery, and reserve forces
that would have to come ashore in
Higgins boats (LCVPs). The critical
water depth over the reef was four
feet, enough to float a laden LCVP.
Anything less and the troops would
have to wade ashore several hundred
yards against that panoply of
Japanese weapons.</p>

<p>Major Frank Holland, a New
Zealand reserve officer with 15 years’
experience sailing the waters of Tarawa,
flatly predicted, “there won’t be
three feet of water on the reef!”
Shoup took Holland’s warnings seriously
and made sure the troops knew
in advance that “there was a 50-50
chance of having to wade ashore.”</p>

<p>In the face of the daunting
Japanese defenses and the physical
constraints of the island, Shoup proposed
a landing plan which included
a sustained preliminary
bombardment, advance seizure of
neighboring Bairiki Island as an artillery
fire base, and a decoy landing.
General Smith took this proposal to
the planning conference in Pearl Harbor
with the principal officers involved
in Operation Galvanic:
Admirals Nimitz, Spruance, Turner,
and Hill, and Major General Holland
Smith.</p>

<p>The Marines were stunned to hear
the restrictions imposed on their assault
by CinCPac. Nimitz declared
that the requirement for strategic surprise
limited preliminary bombardment
of Betio to about three hours
on the morning of D-Day. The imperative
to concentrate naval forces
to defend against a Japanese fleet sortie
also ruled out advance seizure of
Bairiki and any decoy landings. Then
Holland Smith announced his own
bombshell: the 6th Marines would be
withheld as corps reserve.</p>

<p>All of Julian Smith’s tactical options
had been stripped away. The 2d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Marine Division was compelled to
make a frontal assault into the teeth
of Betio’s defenses with an abbreviated
preparatory bombardment.
Worse, loss of the 6th Marines meant
he would be attacking the island fortress
with only a 2-to-1 superiority
in troops, well below the doctrinal
minimum. Shaken, he insisted that
Holland Smith absolve him of any
responsibility for the consequences.
This was done.</p>

<p>David Shoup returned to New
Zealand to prepare a modified operations
order and select the landing
beaches. Betio, located on the southwestern
tip of Tarawa near the entrance
to the lagoon, took the shape
of a small bird, lying on its back,
with its breast facing north, into the
lagoon. The Japanese had concentrated
their defenses on the southern and
western coasts, roughly the bird’s
head and back (where they themselves
had landed). By contrast, the
northern beaches (the bird’s breast)
had calmer waters in the lagoon and,
with one deadly exception (the “re-entrant”),
were convex. Defenses in
this sector were being improved daily
but were not yet complete. A
1,000-yard pier which jutted due
north over the fringing reef into deeper
lagoon waters (in effect, the bird’s
legs) was an attractive logistics target.
It was an easy decision to select
the northern coast for landing
beaches, but there was no real safe
avenue of approach.</p>

<p>Looking at the north shore of Betio
from the line of departure within
the lagoon, Shoup designated three
landing beaches, each 600 yards in
length. From right to left these were:
Red Beach One, from Betio’s northwestern
tip (the bird’s beak) to a
point just east of the re-entrant; Red
Beach Two, from that juncture to the
pier; Red Beach Three, from the pier
eastward. Other beaches were designated
as contingencies, notably
Green Beach along the western shore
(the bird’s head).</p>

<p>Julian Smith had intended to land
with two regiments abreast and one
in reserve. Loss of the 6th Marines
forced a major change. Shoup’s
modified plan assigned the 2d Marines,
reinforced by Landing Team
(LT) 2/8 (2d Battalion, 8th Marines),
as the assault force. The rest of the
8th Marines would constitute the division
reserve. The attack would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
preceded by advance seizure of the
pier by the regimental scout sniper
platoon (Lieutenant William D.
Hawkins). Landing abreast at H-Hour
would be LT 3/2 (3d Battalion,
2d Marines) (Major John F. Schoettel)
on Red One; LT 2/2 (2d Battalion,
2d Marines) (Lieutenant Colonel
Herbert R. Amey, Jr.) on Red Two;
and LT 2/8 (Major Henry P. Jim
Crowe) on Red Three. Major Wood
B. Kyle’s LT 1/2 (1st Battalion, 2d
Marines) would be on call as the
regimental reserve.</p>

  <span class="smaller">TARAWA ATOLL, GILBERT ISLANDS</span></p>
  <p class="small">TAKEN FROM 2D MAR DIV
     SPECIAL ACTION REPORT</p></div></div>

<p>General Smith scheduled a large-scale
amphibious exercise in Hawkes
Bay for the first of November and
made arrangements for New Zealand
trucks to haul the men back to Wellington
at the conclusion in time for
a large dance. Complacently, the entire
2d Marine Division embarked
aboard 16 amphibious ships for the
routine exercise. It was all an artful
ruse. The ships weighed anchor and
headed north for Operation Galvanic.
For once, “Tokyo Rose” had no
clue of the impending campaign.</p>

<p>Most of Task Force 53 assembled
in Efate, New Hebrides, on 7 November.
Admiral Hill arrived on board
<i>Maryland</i>. The Marines, now keenly
aware that an operation was underway,
were more interested in the
arrival from Noumea of 14 new
Sherman M4-A2 tanks on board the
dock landing ship <i>Ashland</i> (LSD 1).
The division had never operated with
medium tanks before.</p>

<p>The landing rehearsals at Efate did
little to prepare the Marines for Betio.
The fleet carriers and their embarked
air wings were off assaulting
targets in the Solomons. The Sherman
tanks had no place to offload.
The new LVT-2s were presumably
somewhere to the north, underway
directly for Tarawa. Naval gun ships
bombarded Erradaka Island, well
away from the troops landing at
Mele Bay.</p>

<p>One overlooked aspect of the rehearsal
paid subsequent dividends
for the Marines in the coming assault.
Major William K. “Willie K.”
Jones, commanding LT 1/6, took the
opportunity to practice embarking
his troops in rubber rafts. In the pre-war
Fleet Marine Force, the first battalion
in each regiment had been
designated “the rubber boat battalion.”
The uncommon sight of this
mini-flotilla inspired numerous catcalls
from the other Marines. Jones
himself was dubbed “The Admiral of
the Condom Fleet.”</p>

<p>The contentious issue during the
post-rehearsal critique was the suitability
of the naval gunfire plan. The
target island was scheduled to receive
the greatest concentration of naval
gunfire of the war to date. Many
senior naval officers were optimistic
of the outcome. “We do not intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to neutralize [the island], we do not
intend to destroy it,” boasted one admiral,
“Gentlemen, we will obliterate
it.” But General Smith had heard
enough of these boasts. In a voice
taut with anger he stood to address
the meeting: “Even though you naval
officers do come in to about 1,000
yards, I remind you that you have a
little armor. I want you to know the
Marines are crossing the beach with
bayonets, and the only armor they’ll
have is a khaki shirt!”</p>

<p>While at Efate, Colonel William
Marshall, commanding Combat
Team Two and scheduled for the
major assault role at Betio, became
too ill to continue. In a memorable
decision, General Smith promoted
David Shoup to colonel and ordered
him to relieve Colonel Marshall.
Shoup knew the 2d Marines, and he
certainly knew the plan. The architect
was about to become the executor.</p>

<p>Once underway from Efate, Admiral
Hill ordered the various commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of Task Force 53 to brief the
troops on their destination and mission.
Tarawa came as a surprise to
most of the men. Many had wagered
they were heading for Wake Island.
On the day before D-Day, General
Julian Smith sent a message “to the
officers and men of the 2d Division.”
In it, the commanding general sought
to reassure his men that, unlike the
Guadalcanal campaign, the Navy
would stay and provide support
throughout. The troops listened attentively
to these words coming over
the loudspeakers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A great offensive to destroy
the enemy in the Central Pacific
has begun. Our Navy screens
our operation and will support
our attack tomorrow with the
greatest concentration of aerial
bombardment and naval gunfire
in the history of warfare. It
will remain with us until our
objective is secured.... Garrison
troops are already enroute
to relieve us as soon as we have
completed our job.... Good
luck and God bless you all.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the sun began to set on Task
Force 53 on the evening of D-minus-one,
it appeared that strategic surprise
had indeed been attained. More
good news came with the report that
the small convoy of LSTs bearing
LVT-2s had arrived safely from
Samoa and was joining the formation.
All the pieces seemed to be coming
together.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1"><span class="redcap">M</span>ajor</span> General Julian C. Smith’s utmost concern
when he assumed command of the 2d Marine
Division on 1 May 1943 was the physical condition
of the troops. The division had redeployed to New
Zealand from Guadalcanal with nearly 13,000 confirmed
cases of malaria. Half the division would have to be
replaced before the next campaign. The infantry regiments
of the 2d Marine Division were the 2d, 6th, and 8th Marines;
the artillery regiment was the 10th Marines; and the
engineers, pioneers, and Naval Construction Battalion
(“Seabees”) were consolidated into the 18th Marines. These
were the principal commanders as the division began its
intensified training program leading to Operation Galvanic:</p>

<ul>
<li>CO, 2d Marines: Col William M. Marshall</li>
<li class="in2">CO, 1/2: Maj Wood B. Kyle</li>

<li>CO, 10th Marines: BGen Thomas E. Bourke</li>
<li>CO, 18th Marines: Col Cyril W. Martyr</li>
</ul>

<p>Other officers who would emerge in key roles at Tarawa
included Brigadier General Leo D. Hermle, Assistant Division
Commander; Lieutenant Colonel Presley M. Rixey,
commanding 1/10, a pack-howitzer battalion supporting
the 2d Marines; Lieutenant Colonel Alexander B. Swenceski,
commanding the composite 2d Tank Battalion; Major
Henry C. Drewes, commanding 2d Amphibian Tractor Battalion;
Major Michael P. Ryan, commanding Company L,
3/2; and First Lieutenant William D. Hawkins, commanding
the Scout Sniper Platoon in the 2d Marines. Altogether,
18,088 Marines and sailors of the division participated in
the assault on Tarawa Atoll. About 55 percent were combat
veterans. Unlike Guadalcanal, the Marines at Tarawa
carried modern infantry weapons, including Garand M-1
semi-automatic rifles, Browning automatic rifles, and portable
flamethrowers. Assault Marines landed with a combat
load consisting of knapsack, poncho, entrenching tool,
bayonet, field rations, and gas masks (quickly discarded).
Many of those carrying heavy weapons, ammunition, or
radios drowned during the hectic debarkation from landing
craft under fire at the reef’s edge.</p>

<p class="drop-cap redcap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> epic battle of Tarawa was the pinnacle of Julian
Smith’s life and career. Smith was 58 and had been
a Marine Corps officer for 34 years at the time of
Operation Galvanic. He was born in Elkton, Maryland, and
graduated from the University of Delaware. Overseas service
included expeditionary tours in Panama, Mexico, Haiti,
Santo Domingo, Cuba, and Nicaragua. He graduated
from the Naval War College in 1917 and, as did many other
frustrated Marine officers, spent the duration of World War
I in Quantico. As were shipmates Colonel Merritt A. Edson
and Major Henry P. Crowe, Smith was a distinguished
marksman and former rifle team coach. Command experience
in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) was limited. He
commanded the 5th Marines in 1938, and he was commanding
officer of the FMF Training School at New River
until being ordered to the 2d Marine Division in May 1943.</p>

<p>Smith’s contemporaries had a high respect for him.
Although unassuming and self-effacing, “there was nothing
wrong with his fighting heart.” Lieutenant Colonel Ray
Murray, one of his battalion commanders, described him
as “a fine old gentleman of high moral fiber; you’d fight
for him.” Smith’s troops perceived that their commanding
general had a genuine love for them.</p>

<p>Julian Smith knew what to expect from the neap tides
at Betio. “I’m an old railbird shooter up on the marshes of
the Chesapeake Bay,” he said, “You push over the marshes
at high tide, and when you have a neap tide, you can’t get
over the marshes.” His landing boats were similarly restricted
as they went in toward Tarawa.</p>

<p>Smith was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for
Tarawa to go with the Navy Cross he received for heroic
acts in Nicaragua a decade earlier. The balance of his career
was unremarkable. He retired as a lieutenant general in
1946, and he died in 1975, age 90. To the end of his life
he valued his experience at Betio. As he communicated to
the officers and men of the division after the battle: “It will
always be a source of supreme satisfaction and pride to be
able to say, ‘I was with the 2d Marine Division at Tarawa.’”

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Tarawa</span> was the first large-scale encounter between
U.S. Marines and the Japanese <i>Special Naval Landing
Forces</i>. The division intelligence staff had forewarned
that “naval units of this type are usually more highly
trained and have a greater tenacity and fighting spirit
than the average Japanese Army unit,” but the Marines were
surprised at the ferocity of the defenders on Betio.</p>

<p>The Japanese “Imperial Marines” earned the grudging
respect of their American counterparts for their esprit, discipline,
marksmanship, proficiency with heavy weapons,
small-unit leadership, manifest bravery, and a stoic willingness
to die to the last man. Major William K. Jones,
whose 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, engaged more of the enemy
in hand-to-hand combat on Betio than any other unit,
said “these [defenders] were pretty tough, and they were
big, six-foot, the biggest Japs that I ever saw.” Major
Lawrence C. Hays reported that “their equipment was excellent
and there was plenty of surplus found, including
large amounts of ammo.”</p>

<p>The Japanese used <i>Special Naval Landing Forces</i> frequently
in the early years of the war. In December 1941,
a force of 5,000 landed on Guam, and another unit of 450
assaulted Wake Island. A small detachment of 113 men was
the first Japanese reinforcing unit to land on Guadalcanal,
10 days after the American landing. A 350-man SNLF
detachment provided fierce resistance to the 1st Marine Division
landings on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo early in
the Guadalcanal campaign. A typical SNLF unit in a defensive
role was commanded by a navy captain and consisted
of three rifle companies augmented by antiaircraft, coast
defense, antiboat, and field artillery units of several batteries
each, plus service and labor troops.</p>

<p><i>The Japanese garrison on Betio conducts pre-battle training.</i></p></div></div>

<p>The Japanese garrison on Betio on D-Day consisted of
the <i>3d Special Base Force</i> (formerly the <i>6th Yokosuka Special
Naval Landing Force</i>), the <i>7th Sasebo Special Naval
Landing Force</i> (which included 200 NCOs and officers of
the <i>Tateyama Naval Gunnery School</i>), the <i>111th Pioneers</i>,
and the <i>4th Construction Unit</i>, an estimated grand total
of 4,856 men.</p>

<p>All crew-served weapons on Betio, from 7.7mm light
machine guns to eight-inch naval rifles, were integrated into
the fortified defensive system that included 500 pillboxes,
blockhouses, and other emplacements. The basic beach
defense weapon faced by the Marines during their landings
on the northern coast was the M93 13mm, dual purpose
(antiair, antiboat) heavy machine gun. In many
seawall emplacements, these lethal weapons were sited to
provide flanking fire along wire entanglements and other
boat obstacles. Flanking fire discipline was insured by sealing
off the front embrasures.</p>

<p>Admiral Shibasaki organized his troops on Betio for “an
overall decisive defense at the beach.” His men fought with
great valor. After 76 hours of bitter fighting, 4,690 lay dead.
Most of the 146 prisoners taken were conscripted Korean
laborers.</p>

<p>Only 17 wounded Japanese surrendered.

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="D-Day_at_Betio" id="D-Day_at_Betio"></a><i>D-Day at Betio,<br />
20 November 1943</i></h2>


<p>The crowded transports of Task
Force 53 arrived off Tarawa Atoll
shortly after midnight on D-Day. Debarkation
began at 0320. The captain
of the <i>Zeilin</i> (APA 3) played the Marines
Hymn over the public address
system, and the sailors cheered as the
2d Battalion, 2d Marines, crawled
over the side and down the cargo
nets.</p>

<p>At this point, things started to go
wrong. Admiral Hill discovered that
the transports were in the wrong anchorage,
masking some of the fire
support ships, and directed them to
shift immediately to the correct site.
The landing craft bobbed along in
the wake of the ships; some Marines
had been halfway down the cargo
nets when the ships abruptly
weighed anchor. Matching the exact
LVTs with their assigned assault
teams in the darkness became
haphazard. Choppy seas made cross-deck
transfers between the small craft
dangerous.</p>

<p>Few tactical plans survive the
opening rounds of execution, particularly
in amphibious operations.
“The Plan” for D-Day at Betio established
H-Hour for the assault waves
at 0830. Strike aircraft from the fast
carriers would initiate the action with
a half-hour bombing raid at 0545.
Then the fire support ships would
bombard the island from close range
for the ensuing 130 minutes. The
planes would return for a final strafing
run at H-minus-five, then shift to
inland targets as the Marines stormed
ashore. None of this went according
to plan.</p>

<p>The Japanese initiated the battle.
Alerted by the pre-dawn activities
offshore, the garrison opened fire on
the task force with their big naval
guns at 0507. The main batteries of
the battleships <i>Colorado</i> (BB 45) and
<i>Maryland</i> commenced counterbattery
fire almost immediately. Several
16-inch shells found their mark; a
huge fireball signalled destruction of
an ammunition bunker for one of the
Japanese gun positions. Other fire
support ships joined in. At 0542 Hill
ordered “cease fire,” expecting the air
attack to commence momentarily.
There was a long silence.</p>

<p>The carrier air group had changed
its plans, postponing the strike by 30
minutes. Inexplicably, that unilateral
modification was never transmitted
to Admiral Hill, the amphibious
task force commander. Hill’s
problems were further compounded
by the sudden loss of communications
on his flagship <i>Maryland</i> with
the first crashing salvo of the ship’s
main battery. The Japanese coastal
defense guns were damaged but still
dangerous. The American mix-up
provided the defenders a grace period
of 25 minutes to recover and adjust.
Frustrated at every turn, Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
ordered his ships to resume firing at
0605. Suddenly, at 0610, the aircraft
appeared, bombing and strafing the
island for the next few minutes.
Amid all this, the sun rose, red and
ominous through the thick smoke.</p>

<p><i>A detailed view of Division D-2 situation map of western Betio
was prepared one month before the landing. Note the
predicted position of Japanese defenses along Green Beach
and Red Beach One, especially those within the “re-entrant”
cove along the north shore. Intelligence projections proved
almost 90 percent accurate and heavy casualties resulted.</i></p></div></div>

<p>The battleships, cruisers, and destroyers
of Task Force 53 began a saturation
bombardment of Betio for the
next several hours. The awesome
shock and sounds of the shelling
were experienced avidly by the Marines.
Staff Sergeant Norman Hatch,
a combat photographer, thought to
himself, “we just really didn’t see how
we could do [anything] but go in
there and bury the people ... this
wasn’t going to be a fight.” <i>Time</i> correspondent
Robert Sherrod thought,
“surely, no mortal men could live
through such destroying power ... any
Japs on the island would all be
dead by now.” Sherrod’s thoughts
were rudely interrupted by a geyser
of water 50 yards astern of the ship.
The Japanese had resumed fire and
their targets were the vulnerable
transports. The troop ships hastily
got underway for the second time
that morning.</p>

<p>For Admiral Hill and General
Julian Smith on board <i>Maryland</i>, the
best source of information throughout
the long day would prove to be
the Vought-Sikorsky Type OS2U
Kingfisher observation aircraft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
launched by the battleships. At 0648,
Hill inquired of the pilot of one float
plane, “Is reef covered with water?”
The answer was a cryptic “negative.”
At that same time, the LVTs of Wave
One, with 700 infantrymen embarked,
left the assembly area and
headed for the line of departure.</p>

<p>The crews and embarked troops in
the LVTs had already had a long
morning, complete with hair-raising
cross-deck transfers in the choppy
sea and the unwelcome thrill of eight-inch
shells landing in their proximity.
Now they were commencing an
extremely long run to the beach, a
distance of nearly 10 miles. The craft
started on time but quickly fell behind
schedule. The LVT-1s of the first
wave failed to maintain the planned
4.5-knot speed of advance due to a
strong westerly current, decreased
buoyancy from the weight of the improvised
armor plating, and their
overaged power plants. There was a
psychological factor at work as well.
“Red Mike” Edson had criticized the
LVT crews for landing five minutes
early during the rehearsal at Efate,
saying, “early arrival inexcusable, late
arrival preferable.” Admiral Hill and
General Smith soon realized that the
three struggling columns of LVTs
would never make the beach by
0830. H-Hour was postponed twice,
to 0845, then to 0900. Here again, not
all hands received this word.</p>

<p>The destroyers <i>Ringgold</i> (DD 500)
and <i>Dashiell</i> (DD 659) entered the lagoon
in the wake of two minesweepers
to provide close-in fire support.
Once in the lagoon, the minesweeper
<i>Pursuit</i> (AM 108) became the
Primary Control Ship, taking position
directly on the line of departure.
<i>Pursuit</i> turned her searchlight seaward
to provide the LVTs with a beacon
through the thick dust and
smoke. Finally, at 0824, the first wave
of LVTs crossed the line, still 6,000
yards away from the target beaches.</p>

<p>A minute later the second group
of carrier aircraft roared over Betio,
right on time for the original H-Hour,
but totally unaware of the new
times. This was another blunder. Admiral
Kelly Turner had specifically
provided all players in Operation
Galvanic with this admonition:
“Times of strafing beaches with reference
to H-Hour are approximate; the
distance of the boats from the beach
is the governing factor.” Admiral Hill
had to call them off. The planes remained
on station, but with depleted
fuel and ammunition levels
available.</p>

<p>The LVTs struggled shoreward in
three long waves, each separated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
a 300-yard interval: the 42 LVT-1s of
Wave One, followed by 24 LVT-2s of
Wave Two, and 21 LVT-2s of Wave
Three. Behind the tracked vehicles
came Waves Four and Five of LCVPs.
Each of the assault battalion commanders
were in Wave Four. Further
astern, the <i>Ashland</i> ballasted down
and launched 14 LCMs, each carrying
a Sherman medium tank. Four
other LCMs appeared carrying light
tanks (37mm guns).</p>

<p>Shortly before 0800, Colonel
Shoup and elements of his tactical
command post debarked into LCVPs
from <i>Biddle</i> (APA 8) and headed for
the line of departure. Close by Shoup
stood an enterprising sergeant, energetically
shielding his bulky radio

communications blackouts and
failures on D-Day, Shoup’s radio
would remain functional longer and

<p>Admiral Hill ordered a ceasefire at
0854, even though the waves were
still 4,000 yards off shore. General
Smith and “Red Mike” Edson objected
strenuously, but Hill considered
the huge pillars of smoke unsafe for
overhead fire support of the assault
waves. The great noise abruptly
ceased. The LVTs making their final
approach soon began to receive long-range
machine gun fire and artillery
air-bursts. The latter could have been
fatal to the troops crowded into
open-topped LVTs, but the Japanese
had overloaded the projectiles with
high explosives. Instead of steel shell
fragments, the Marines were “doused
with hot sand.” It was the last tactical
mistake the Japanese would make
that day.</p>

<p>The previously aborted air strike
returned at 0855 for five minutes of
noisy but ineffective strafing along
the beaches, the pilots again heeding
their wristwatches instead of the
progress of the lead LVTs.</p>

<p>Two other events occurred at this
time. A pair of naval landing boats
darted towards the end of the long
pier at the reef’s edge. Out charged
First Lieutenant Hawkins with his
scout-sniper platoon and a squad of
combat engineers. These shock
troops made quick work of Japanese
machine gun emplacements along the
pier with explosives and flame
throwers. Meanwhile, the LVTs of
Wave One struck the reef and
crawled effortlessly over it, commencing
their final run to the beach.
These parts of Shoup’s landing plan
worked to perfection.</p>

<p>But the preliminary bombardment,
as awesome and unprecedented
as it had been, had failed
significantly to soften the defenses.
Very little ships’ fire had been directed
against the landing beaches themselves,
where Admiral Shibasaki
vowed to defeat the assault units at
the water’s edge. The well-protected
defenders simply shook off the sand
and manned their guns. Worse, the
near-total curtailment of naval gunfire
for the final 25 minutes of the assault
run was a fateful lapse. In
effect, the Americans gave their opponents
time to shift forces from the
southern and western beaches to
reinforce northern positions. The
defenders were groggy from the
pounding and stunned at the sight of
LVTs crossing the barrier reef, but
Shibasaki’s killing zone was still
largely intact. The assault waves were
greeted by a steadily increasing
volume of combined arms fire.</p>

<p>For Wave One, the final 200 yards
to the beach were the roughest, especially
for those LVTs approaching
Red Beaches One and Two. The vehicles
were hammered by well-aimed
fire from heavy and light machine
guns and 40mm antiboat guns. The
Marines fired back, expending 10,000
rounds from the .50-caliber machine
guns mounted forward on each
LVT-1. But the exposed gunners were
easy targets, and dozens were cut
down. Major Drewes, the LVT battalion
commander who had worked
so hard with Shoup to make this assault
possible, took over one machine
gun from a fallen crewman and was
immediately killed by a bullet
through the brain. Captain Fenlon A.
Durand, one of Drewes’ company
commanders, saw a Japanese officer
standing defiantly on the seawall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
waving a pistol, “just daring us to
come ashore.”</p>

<p>On they came. Initial touchdown
times were staggered: 0910 on Red
Beach One; 0917 on Red Beach
Three; 0922 on Red Beach Two. The
first LVT ashore was vehicle number
4-9, nicknamed “My Deloris,” driven
by PFC Edward J. Moore. “My
Deloris” was the right guide vehicle
in Wave One on Red Beach One, hitting
the beach squarely on “the bird’s
beak.” Moore tried his best to drive
his LVT over the five-foot seawall,
but the vehicle stalled in a near-vertical
position while nearby
machine guns riddled the cab. Moore
reached for his rifle only to find it
shot in half. One of the embarked
troops was 19-year-old Private First
Class Gilbert Ferguson, who recalled
what happened next on board the
LVT: “The sergeant stood up and
yelled ‘everybody out.’ At that very
instant, machine gun bullets appeared
to rip his head off....” Ferguson,
Moore, and others escaped
from the vehicle and dispatched two
machine gun positions only yards
away. All became casualties in short
order.</p>

<p>Very few of the LVTs could negotiate
the seawall. Stalled on the beach,
the vehicles were vulnerable to
preregistered mortar and howitzer
fire, as well as hand grenades tossed
into the open troop compartments by
Japanese troops on the other side of
the barrier. The crew chief of one vehicle,
Corporal John Spillane, had
been a baseball prospect with the St.
Louis Cardinals organization before
the war. Spillane caught two
Japanese grenades barehanded in
mid-air, tossing them back over the
wall. A third grenade exploded in his
hand, grievously wounding him.</p>

<p>The second and third waves of
LVT-2s, protected only by 3/8-inch
boiler plate hurriedly installed in
Samoa, suffered even more intense
fire. Several were destroyed spectacularly
by large-caliber antiboat guns.
Private First Class Newman M.
Baird, a machine gunner aboard one
embattled vehicle, recounted his ordeal:
“We were 100 yards in now and
the enemy fire was awful damn intense
and getting worse. They were
knocking [LVTs] out left and right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
A tractor’d get hit, stop, and burst
into flames, with men jumping out
like torches.” Baird’s own vehicle was
then hit by a shell, killing the crew
and many of the troops. “I grabbed
my carbine and an ammunition box
and stepped over a couple of fellas
lying there and put my hand on the
side so’s to roll over into the water.
I didn’t want to put my head up. The
bullets were pouring at us like a sheet
of rain.”</p>

<p>On balance, the LVTs performed
their assault mission fully within
Julian Smith’s expectations. Only
eight of the 87 vehicles in the first
three waves were lost in the assault
(although 15 more were so riddled
with holes that they sank upon
reaching deep water while seeking to
shuttle more troops ashore). Within
a span of 10 minutes, the LVTs landed
more than 1,500 Marines on Betio’s
north shore, a great start to the
operation. The critical problem lay
in sustaining the momentum of the
assault. Major Holland’s dire predictions
about the neap tide had proven
accurate. No landing craft would
cross the reef throughout D-Day.</p>

<p>Shoup hoped enough LVTs would
survive to permit wholesale transfer-line
operations with the boats along
the edge of the reef. It rarely worked.
The LVTs suffered increasing casualties.
Many vehicles, afloat for five
hours already, simply ran of gas.
Others had to be used immediately
for emergency evacuation of wounded
Marines. Communications, never
good, deteriorated as more and more
radio sets suffered water damage or
enemy fire. The surviving LVTs continued
to serve, but after about 1000
on D-Day, most troops had no other
option but to wade ashore from the
reef, covering distances from 500 to
1,000 yards under well-aimed fire.</p>

<p>Marines of Major Schoettel’s LT
3/2 were particularly hard hit on Red
Beach One. Company K suffered
heavy casualties from the re-entrant
strongpoint on the left. Company I
made progress over the seawall along
the “bird’s beak,” but paid a high
price, including the loss of the company
commander, Captain William
E. Tatom, killed before he could even
debark from his LVT. Both units lost
half their men in the first two hours.
Major Michael P. “Mike” Ryan’s
Company L, forced to wade ashore
when their boats grounded on the
reef, sustained 35 percent casualties.
Ryan recalled the murderous enfilading
fire and the confusion. Suddenly,
“one lone trooper was spotted
through the fire and smoke scrambling
over a parapet on the beach to
the right,” marking a new landing
point. As Ryan finally reached the
beach, he looked back over his shoulder.
“All [I] could see was heads with
rifles held over them,” as his wading
men tried to make as small a target
as possible. Ryan began assembling
the stragglers of various waves in a
relatively sheltered area along Green
Beach.</p>

<p>Major Schoettel remained in his
boat with the remnants of his fourth
wave, convinced that his landing
team had been shattered beyond
relief. No one had contact with Ryan.
The fragmented reports Schoettel
received from the survivors of the
two other assault companies were
disheartening. Seventeen of his 37
officers were casualties.</p>

<p>In the center, Landing Team 2/2
was also hard hit coming ashore over
Red Beach Two. The Japanese strongpoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
in the re-entrant between the
two beaches played havoc among
troops trying to scramble over the
sides of their beached or stalled LVTs.
Five of Company E’s six officers were
killed. Company F suffered 50 percent
casualties getting ashore and
swarming over the seawall to seize a
precarious foothold. Company G
could barely cling to a crowded
stretch of beach along the seawall in
the middle. Two infantry platoons
and two machine gun platoons were
driven away from the objective beach
and forced to land on Red Beach
One, most joining “Ryans Orphans.”</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Colonel Amey’s
boat rammed to a sudden halt
against the reef, he hailed two passing
LVTs for a transfer. Amey’s LVT
then became hung up on a barbed
wire obstacle several hundred yards
off Red Beach Two. The battalion
commander drew his pistol and exhorted
his men to follow him into the
water. Closer to the beach, Amey
turned to encourage his staff, “Come
on! Those bastards can’t beat us!” A
burst of machine gun fire hit him in
the throat, killing him instantly. His
executive office, Major Howard Rice,
was in another LVT which was
forced to land far to the west, behind
Major Ryan. The senior officer
present with 2/2 was Lieutenant
Colonel Walter Jordan, one of several
observers from the 4th Marine Division
and one of only a handful of
survivors from Amey’s LVT. Jordan
did what any Marine would do under
the circumstances: he assumed
command and tried to rebuild the
disjointed pieces of the landing team
into a cohesive fighting force. The
task was enormous.</p>

<p>The only assault unit to get ashore
without significant casualties was
Major “Jim” Crowe’s LT 2/8 on Red
Beach Three to the left of the pier.
Many historians have attributed this
good fortune to the continued direct
fire support 2/8 received throughout
its run to the beach from the destroyers
<i>Ringgold</i> and <i>Dashiell</i> in the lagoon.
The two ships indeed provided
outstanding fire support to the landing
force, but their logbooks indicate
both ships honored Admiral Hill’s
0855 ceasefire; thereafter, neither ship
fired in support of LT 2/8 until at
least 0925. Doubtlessly, the preliminary
fire from such short range
served to keep the Japanese defenders
on the eastern end of the island buttoned
up long after the ceasefire. As
a result, Crowe’s team suffered only
25 casualties in the first three LVT
waves. Company E made a significant
penetration, crossing the barricade
and the near taxiway, but five
of its six officers were shot down in
the first 10 minutes ashore. Crowe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
LT 2/8 was up against some of the
most sophisticated defensive positions
on the island; three fortifications
to their left (eastern) flank
would effectively keep these Marines
boxed in for the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>Major “Jim” Crowe&mdash;former enlisted
man, Marine Gunner, distinguished
rifleman, star football
player&mdash;was a tower of strength
throughout the battle. His trademark
red mustache bristling, a combat
shotgun cradled in his arm, he exuded
confidence and professionalism,
qualities sorely needed on Betio that
long day. Crowe ordered the coxswain
of his LCVP “put this goddamned
boat in!” The boat hit the
reef at high speed, sending the Marines
sprawling. Quickly recovering,
Crowe ordered his men over the
sides, then led them through several
hundred yards of shallow water,
reaching the shore intact only four
minutes behind his last wave of LVTs.
Accompanying Crowe during this
hazardous effort was Staff Sergeant
Hatch, the combat photographer.
Hatch remembers being inspired by
Crowe, clenching a cigar in his teeth
and standing upright, growling at his
men, “Look, the sons of bitches can’t
hit me. Why do you think they can
hit you? Get moving. Go!” Red Beach
Three was in capable hands.</p>

<p>The situation on Betio by 0945 on
D-Day was thus: Crowe, well-established
on the left with modest
penetration to the airfield; a distinct
gap between LT 2/8 and the survivors
of LT 2/2 in small clusters
along Red Beach Two under the tentative
command of Jordan; a dangerous
gap due to the Japanese
fortifications at the re-entrant between
beaches Two and One, with a
few members of 3/2 on the left flank
and the growing collection of odds
and ends under Ryan past the “bird’s
beak” on Green Beach; Major
Schoettel still afloat, hovering beyond
the reef; Colonel Shoup likewise
in an LCVP, but beginning his
move towards the beach; residual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
members of the boated waves of the
assault teams still wading ashore under
increasing enemy fire; the tanks
being forced to unload from their
LCMs at the reef’s edge, trying to organize
recon teams to lead them
ashore.</p>

<p><i>LVT-1s in the first assault wave enter the lagoon and approach the line of departure.

</div>

<p>Communications were ragged. The
balky TBX radios of Shoup, Crowe,
and Schoettel were still operational.
Otherwise, there was either dead silence
or complete havoc on the command
nets. No one on the flagship
knew of Ryan’s relative success on the
western end, or of Amey’s death and
Jordan’s assumption of command.
Several echelons heard this ominous
early report from an unknown
source: “Have landed. Unusually
heavy opposition. Casualties 70 percent.
Can’t hold.” Shoup ordered
Kyle’s LT 1/2, the regimental reserve,
to land on Red Beach Two and work
west.</p>

<p>This would take time. Kyle’s men
were awaiting orders at the line of
departure, but all were embarked in
boats. Shoup and others managed to
assemble enough LVTs to transport
Kyle’s companies A and B, but the
third infantry company and the
weapons company would have to
wade ashore. The ensuing assault
was chaotic. Many of the LVTs were
destroyed enroute by antiboat guns
which increasingly had the range
down pat. At least five vehicles were
driven away by the intense fire and
landed west at Ryan’s position, adding
another 113 troops to Green
Beach. What was left of Companies
A and B stormed ashore and
penetrated several hundred feet, expanding
the “perimeter.” Other troops
sought refuge along the pier or tried
to commandeer a passing LVT. Kyle
got ashore in this fashion, but many
of his troops did not complete the
landing until the following morning.
The experience of Lieutenant George
D. Lillibridge of Company A, 1st Battalion,
2d Marines, was typical. His
LVT driver and gunners were shot
down by machine gun fire. The surviving
crewman got the stranded vehicle
started again, but only in
reverse. The stricken vehicle then
backed wildly though the entire impact
zone before breaking down
again. Lillibridge and his men did not
get ashore until sunset.</p>

<p>The transport <i>Zeilin</i>, which had
launched its Marines with such fanfare
only a few hours earlier, received
its first clear signal that things were
going wrong on the beach when a
derelict LVT chugged close astern
with no one at the controls. The ship
dispatched a boat to retrieve the vehicle.
The sailors discovered three
dead men aboard the LVT: two Marines
and a Navy doctor. The bodies
were brought on board, then
buried with full honors at sea, the
first of hundreds who would be consigned
to the deep as a result of the
maelstrom on Betio.</p>

<p>Communications on board <i>Maryland</i>
were gradually restored to
working order in the hours following
the battleship’s early morning
duel with Betio’s coast defense batteries.
On board the flagship, General
Julian Smith tried to make sense out
of the intermittent and frequently
conflicting messages coming in over
the command net. At 1018 he ordered
Colonel Hall to “chop” Major
Robert H. Ruud’s LT 3/8 to Shoup’s
CT Two. Smith further directed Hall
to begin boating his regimental command
group and LT 1/8 (Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Lawrence C. Hays, Jr.), the division
reserve. At 1036, Smith reported to
V Amphibious Corps: “Successful
landing on Beaches Red Two and
Three. Toehold on Red One. Am
committing one LT from Division
reserve. Still encountering strong
resistance throughout.”</p>

to salvage “My Deloris” during the battle, moving her somewhat
eastward from the original landing point on “the bird’s
beak,” but she was too riddled with shell holes to operate. After
the battle, “My Deloris” was sent to the United States as
an exhibit for War Bond drives. The historic vehicle is now
at the Tracked Vehicle Museum at Camp DelMar, California.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Colonel Shoup at this time was in
the middle of a long odyssey trying
to get ashore. He paused briefly for
this memorable exchange of radio
messages with Major Schoettel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>0959: (Schoettel to Shoup)
“Receiving heavy fire all along
beach. Unable to land all. Issue
in doubt.”</p>

<p>1007: (Schoettel to Shoup)
“Boats held up on reef of right
flank Red 1. Troops receiving
heavy fire in water.”</p>

<p>1012: (Shoup to Schoettel)
“Land Beach Red 2 and work
west.”</p>

<p>1018: (Schoettel to Shoup) “We
have nothing left to land.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When Shoup’s LCVP was stopped
by the reef, he transferred to a passing
LVT. His party included Lieutenant
Colonel Evans F. Carlson,
already a media legend for his earlier
exploits at Makin and Guadalcanal,
now serving as an observer,
and Lieutenant Colonel Presley M.
Rixey, commanding 1st Battalion,
10th Marines, Shoup’s artillery
detachment. The LVT made three attempts
to land; each time the enemy
fire was too intense. On the third try,
the vehicle was hit and disabled by
plunging fire. Shoup sustained a
painful shell fragment wound in his
leg, but led his small party out of the
stricken vehicle and into the dubious
shelter of the pier. From this position,
standing waist-deep in water, surrounded
by thousands of dead fish
and dozens of floating bodies, Shoup
manned his radio, trying desperately
to get organized combat units
ashore to sway the balance.</p>

<p>For awhile, Shoup had hopes that
the new Sherman tanks would serve
to break the gridlock. The combat
debut of the Marine medium tanks,
however, was inauspicious on D-Day.
The tankers were valorous, but
the 2d Marine Division had no concept
of how to employ tanks against
fortified positions. When four Shermans
reached Red Beach Three late
in the morning of D-Day, Major
Crowe simply waved them forward
with orders to “knock out all enemy
positions encountered.” The tank
crews, buttoned up under fire, were
virtually blind. Without accompanying
infantry they were lost piecemeal,
some knocked out by Japanese
75mm guns, others damaged by
American dive bombers.</p>

<p>Six Shermans tried to land on Red
Beach One, each preceded by a dismounted
guide to warn of underwater
shell craters. The guides were
shot down every few minutes by
Japanese marksmen; each time
another volunteer would step forward
to continue the movement.
Combat engineers had blown a hole
in the seawall for the tanks to pass
inland, but the way was now blocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
with dead and wounded Marines.
Rather than run over his fellow Marines,
the commander reversed his
column and proceeded around the
“bird’s beak” towards a second opening
blasted in the seawall. Operating
in the turbid waters now without
guides, four tanks foundered in shell
holes in the detour. Inland from the
beach, one of the surviving Shermans
engaged a plucky Japanese
light tank. The Marine tank
demolished its smaller opponent, but
not before the doomed Japanese crew
released one final 37mm round, a
phenomenal shot, right down the
barrel of the Sherman.</p>

of Marines from 3d Battalion, 2d Marines, were killed
while crossing the sand spit in the extreme lower left corner.</i></p></div></div>

<p>By day’s end, only two of the 14
Shermans were still operational,
“Colorado” on Red Three and “China
Gal” on Red One/Green Beach.
Maintenance crews worked through
the night to retrieve a third tank,
“Cecilia,” on Green Beach for Major
Ryan. Attempts to get light tanks into
the battle fared no better. Japanese
gunners sank all four LCMs laden
with light tanks before the boats even
reached the reef. Shoup also had
reports that the tank battalion commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander
B. Swenceski, had been killed
while wading ashore (Swenceski,
badly wounded, survived by crawling
atop a pile of dead bodies to keep
from drowning until he was finally
discovered on D+1).</p>

<p>Shoup’s message to the flagship at
1045 reflected his frustration: “Stiff
resistance. Need halftracks. Our
tanks no good.” But the Regimental
Weapons Companys halftracks,
mounting 75mm guns, fared no better
getting ashore than did any other
combat unit that bloody morning.
One was sunk in its LCM by long-range
artillery fire before it reached
the reef. A second ran the entire
gauntlet but became stuck in the
loose sand at the water’s edge. The
situation was becoming critical.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos along the exposed
beachhead, individual examples of
courage and initiative inspired the
scattered remnants. Staff Sergeant
William Bordelon, a combat engineer
attached to LT 2/2, provided the first
and most dramatic example on D-Day
morning. When a Japanese shell
disabled his LVT and killed most of
the occupants enroute to the beach,
Bordelon rallied the survivors and
led them ashore on Red Beach Two.
Pausing only to prepare explosive
charges, Bordelon personally
knocked out two Japanese positions
which had been firing on the assault
waves. Attacking a third emplacement,
he was hit by machine gun fire,
but declined medical assistance and
continued the attack. Bordelon then
dashed back into the water to rescue
a wounded Marine calling for help.
As intense fire opened up from yet
another nearby enemy stronghold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the staff sergeant prepared one last
demolition package and charged the
position frontally. Bordelon’s luck
ran out. He was shot and killed, later
to become the first of four men of the
2d Marine Division to be awarded
the Medal of Honor.</p>

<p>In another incident, Sergeant Roy
W. Johnson attacked a Japanese tank
single-handedly, scrambling to the
turret, dropping a grenade inside,
then sitting on the hatch until the
detonation. Johnson survived this incident,
but he was killed in subsequent
fighting on Betio, one of 217
Marine Corps sergeants to be killed
or wounded in the 76-hour battle.</p>

<p>On Red Beach Three, a captain,
shot through both arms and legs,
sent a message to Major Crowe,
apologizing for “letting you down.”
Major Ryan recalled “a wounded sergeant
I had never seen before limping
up to ask me where he was
needed most.” PFC Moore, wounded
and disarmed from his experiences
trying to drive “My Deloris” over the
seawall, carried fresh ammunition up
to machine gun crews the rest of the
day until having to be evacuated to
one of the transports. Other brave individuals
retrieved a pair of 37mm
antitank guns from a sunken landing
craft, manhandled them several
hundred yards ashore under nightmarish
enemy fire, and hustled them
across the beach to the seawall. The
timing was critical. Two Japanese
tanks were approaching the beachhead.
The Marine guns were too low
to fire over the wall. “Lift them over,”
came the cry from a hundred throats,
“LIFT THEM OVER!” Willing hands
hoisted the 900-pound guns atop the
wall. The gunners coolly loaded,
aimed, and fired, knocking out one
tank at close range, chasing off the
other. There were hoarse cheers.</p>

gun fire. The artist himself was with the invading troops.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Time</i> correspondent Robert Sherrod
was no stranger to combat, but
the landing on D-Day at Betio was
one of the most unnerving experiences
in his life. Sherrod accompanied
Marines from the fourth wave
of LT 2/2 attempting to wade ashore
on Red Beach Two. In his words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No sooner had we hit the
water than the Japanese
machine guns really opened up
on us.... It was painfully
slow, wading in such deep
water. And we had seven
hundred yards to walk slowly
into that machine gun fire,
looming into larger targets as
we rose onto higher ground. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
was scared, as I had never been
scared before.... Those who
were not hit would always
remember how the machine
gun bullets hissed into the
water, inches to the right, inches
to the left.</p></blockquote>

Three on D-Day. Carrying a shotgun, he went from foxhole
to foxhole urging his troops forward against heavy enemy fire.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Colonel Shoup, moving slowly
towards the beach along the pier, ordered
Major Ruud’s LT 3/8 to land
on Red Beach Three, east of the pier.
By this time in the morning there
were no organized LVT units left to
help transport the reserve battalion
ashore. Shoup ordered Ruud to approach
as closely as he could by
landing boats, then wade the remaining
distance. Ruud received his assault
orders from Shoup at 1103. For
the next six hours the two officers
were never more than a mile apart,
yet neither could communicate with
the other.</p>

<p>Ruud divided his landing team into
seven waves, but once the boats approached
the reef the distinctions
blurred. Japanese antiboat guns
zeroed in on the landing craft with
frightful accuracy, often hitting just
as the bow ramp dropped. Survivors
reported the distinctive “clang” as a
shell impacted, a split second before
the explosion. “It happened a dozen
times,” recalled Staff Sergeant Hatch,
watching from the beach, “the boat
blown completely out of the water
and smashed and bodies all over the
place.” Robert Sherrod reported from
a different vantage point, “I watched
a Jap shell hit directly on a [landing
craft] that was bringing many Marines
ashore. The explosion was terrific
and parts of the boat flew in all
directions.” Some Navy coxswains,
seeing the slaughter just ahead,
stopped their boats seaward of the
reef and ordered the troops off. The
Marines, many loaded with radios or
wire or extra ammunition, sank immediately
in deep water; most
drowned. The reward for those
troops whose boats made it intact to
the reef was hardly less sanguinary:
a 600-yard wade through withering
crossfire, heavier by far than that endured
by the first assault waves at H-Hour.
The slaughter among the first
wave of Companies K and L was terrible.
Seventy percent fell attempting
to reach the beach.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Shoup and his party
waved frantically to groups of Marines
in the following waves to seek
protection of the pier. A great number
did this, but so many officers and
noncommissioned officers had been
hit that the stragglers were shattered
and disorganized. The pier itself was
a dubious shelter, receiving intermittent
machine gun and sniper fire
from both sides. Shoup himself was
struck in nine places, including a
spent bullet which came close to
penetrating his bull neck. His runner
crouching beside him was drilled between
the eyes by a Japanese sniper.</p>

<p>Captain Carl W. Hoffman, commanding
3/8’s Weapons Company,
had no better luck getting ashore
than the infantry companies ahead.
“My landing craft had a direct hit
from a Japanese mortar. We lost six
or eight people right there.” Hoffman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Marines veered toward the
pier, then worked their way ashore.</p>

<p>Major Ruud, frustrated at being
unable to contact Shoup, radioed his
regimental commander, Colonel
Hall: “Third wave landed on Beach
Red 3 were practically wiped out.
Fourth wave landed ... but only a
few men got ashore.” Hall, himself in
a small boat near the line of departure,
was unable to respond.
Brigadier General Leo D. (“Dutch”)
Hermle, assistant division commander,
interceded with the message,
“Stay where you are or retreat out of
gun range.” This added to the confusion.
As a result, Ruud himself did
not reach the pier until mid-afternoon.
It was 1730 before he
could lead the remnants of his men
ashore; some did not straggle in until
the following day. Shoup dispatched
what was left of LT 3/8 in
support of Crowe’s embattled 2/8;
others were used to help plug the gap
between 2/8 and the combined
troops of 2/2 and 1/2.</p>

<p>Shoup finally reached Betio at
noon and established a command
post 50 yards in from the pier along
the blind side of a large Japanese
bunker, still occupied. The colonel
posted guards to keep the enemy
from launching any unwelcome sorties,
but the approaches to the site itself
were as exposed as any other
place on the flat island. At least two
dozen messengers were shot while
bearing dispatches to and from
Shoup. Sherrod crawled up to the
grim-faced colonel, who admitted,
“We’re in a tight spot. We’ve got to
have more men.” Sherrod looked out
at the exposed waters on both sides
of the pier. Already he could count
50 disabled LVTs, tanks, and boats.
The prospects did not look good.</p>

<p>The first order of business upon
Shoup’s reaching dry ground was to
seek updated reports from the landing
team commanders. If anything,
tactical communications were worse
at noon than they had been during
the morning. Shoup still had no contact
with any troops ashore on Red
Beach One, and now he could no
longer raise General Smith on
<i>Maryland</i>. A dire message came from
LT 2/2: “We need help. Situation
bad.” Later a messenger arrived from
that unit with this report: “All communications
out except runners. CO
killed. No word from E Company.”
Shoup found Lieutenant Colonel Jordan,
ordered him to keep command
of 2/2, and sought to reinforce him
with elements from 1/2 and 3/8.
Shoup gave Jordan an hour to organize
and rearm his assorted detachments,
then ordered him to attack
inland to the airstrip and expand the
beachhead.</p>

<p>Shoup then directed Evans Carlson
to hitch a ride out to the <i>Maryland</i>
and give General Smith and Admiral
Hill a personal report of the situation
ashore. Shoup’s strength of character
was beginning to show. “You tell
the general and the admiral,” he ordered
Carlson, “that we are going to
stick and fight it out.” Carlson
departed immediately, but such were
the hazards and confusion between
the beach and the line of departure
that he did not reach the flagship until
1800.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Captain and crew of</i> Zeilin <i>(APA 3) pause on D-Day to commit casualties to the

</div>

<div class="captionr top"><p>LtGen Julian C. Smith Collection</p></div>
  <img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="431" height="419" alt="" />
</div>


<p>Matters of critical resupply then
captured Shoup’s attention. Beyond
the pier he could see nearly a
hundred small craft, circling aimlessly.
These, he knew, carried assorted
supplies from the transports and cargo
ships, unloading as rapidly as they
could in compliance with Admiral
Nimitz’s stricture to “get the hell in,
then get the hell out.” The indiscriminate
unloading was hindering
prosecution of the fight ashore.
Shoup had no idea which boat held
which supplies. He sent word to the
Primary Control Officer to send only
the most critical supplies to the pierhead:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
ammunition, water, blood
plasma, stretchers, LVT fuel, more
radios.</p>

<p>Shoup then conferred with Lieutenant
Colonel Rixey. While naval
gunfire support since the landing had
been magnificent, it was time for the
Marines to bring their own artillery
ashore. The original plan to land the
1st Battalion/10th Marines, on Red
One was no longer practical. Shoup
and Rixey agreed to try a landing on
the left flank of Red Two, close to the
pier. Rixey’s guns were 75mm pack
howitzers, boated in LCVPs. The expeditionary
guns could be broken
down for manhandling. Rixey, having
seen from close at hand what
happened when LT 3/8 had tried to
wade ashore from the reef, went after
the last remaining LVTs. There
were enough operational vehicles for
just two sections of Batteries A and
B. In the confusion of transfer-line
operations, three sections of Battery
C followed the LVTs shoreward in
their open boats. Luck was with the
artillerymen. The LVTs landed their
guns intact by late afternoon. When
the trailing boats hung up on the reef,
the intrepid Marines humped the
heavy components through the
bullet-swept waters to the pier and
eventually ashore at twilight. There
would be close-in fire support available
at daybreak.</p>

<p>Julian Smith knew little of these
events, and he continued striving to
piece together the tactical situation
ashore. From observation reports
from staff officers aloft in the float
planes, he concluded that the situation
in the early afternoon was
desperate. Although elements of five
infantry battalions were ashore, their
toehold was at best precarious. As
Smith later recalled, “the gap between
Red 1 and Red 2 had not been closed
and the left flank on Red 3 was by
no means secure.”</p>

<p>Smith assumed that Shoup was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
still alive and functioning, but he
could ill afford to gamble. For the
next several hours the commanding
general did his best to influence the
action ashore from the flagship.
Smith’s first step was the most critical.
At 1331 he sent a radio message
to General Holland Smith, reporting
“situation in doubt” and requesting
release of the 6th Marines to division
control. In the meantime, having ordered
his last remaining landing team
(Hays’ 1/8) to the line of departure,
Smith began reconstituting an emergency
division reserve comprised of
bits and pieces of the artillery, engineer,
and service troop units.</p>

<p>General Smith at 1343 ordered
General Hermle to proceed to the end
of the pier, assess the situation and
report back. Hermle and his small
staff promptly debarked from <i>Monrovia</i>
(APA 31) and headed towards
the smoking island, but the trip took
four hours.</p>

<div id="ip_23b" class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">

  <img src="images/i_023a.jpg" width="210" height="252" alt="" />
</div>


<p>In the meantime, General Smith
intercepted a 1458 message from
Major Schoettel, still afloat seaward
of the reef: “CP located on back of
Red Beach 1. Situation as before.
Have lost contact with assault elements.”
Smith answered in no uncertain
terms: “Direct you land at any
cost, regain control your battalion
and continue the attack.” Schoettel
complied, reaching the beach around
sunset. It would be well into the next
day before he could work his way
west and consolidate his scattered
remnants.</p>

<p>At 1525, Julian Smith received
Holland Smith’s authorization to take
control of the 6th Marines. This was
good news. Smith now had four battalion
landing teams (including 1/8)
available. The question then became
where to feed them into the fight
without getting them chewed to
pieces like Ruud’s experience in trying
to land 3/8.</p>

<div id="ip_23c" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Getting ashore on D-Day took great courage and determination. Attacking inland

  <img src="images/i_023b.jpg" width="430" height="259" alt="" />
</div>


<p>At this point, Julian Smith’s communications
failed him again. At
1740, he received a faint message that
Hermle had finally reached the pier
and was under fire. Ten minutes later,
Smith ordered Hermle to take command
of all forces ashore. To his subsequent
chagrin, Hermle never
received this word. Nor did Smith
know his message failed to get
through. Hermle stayed at the pier,
sending runners to Shoup (who unceremoniously
told him to “get the
hell out from under that pier!”) and
trying with partial success to unscrew
the two-way movement of casualties
out to sea and supplies to shore.</p>

<p>Throughout the long day Colonel
Hall and his regimental staff had languished
in their LCVPs adjacent to
Hays’ LT 1/8 at the line of departure,
“cramped, wet, hungry, tired and a
large number ... seasick.” In late afternoon,
Smith abruptly ordered
Hall to land his remaining units on
a new beach on the northeast tip of
the island at 1745 and work west
towards Shoup’s ragged lines. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
was a tremendous risk. Smith’s overriding
concern that evening was a
Japanese counterattack from the
eastern tail of the island against his
left flank (Crowe and Ruud). Once
he had been given the 6th Marines,
Smith admitted he was “willing to
sacrifice a battalion landing team” if
it meant saving the landing force
from being overrun during darkness.</p>

  <div class="captionl">

<p><i>Marines try to drag a wounded comrade to safety and medical treatment on D-Day.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Fortunately, as it turned out, Hall
never received this message from
Smith. Later in the afternoon, a float
plane reported to Smith that a unit
was crossing the line of departure
and heading for the left flank of Red
Beach Two. Smith and Edson assumed
it was Hall and Hays going in
on the wrong beach. The fog of war:
the movement reported was the beginning
of Rixey’s artillerymen moving
ashore. The 8th Marines spent
the night in its boats, waiting for orders.
Smith did not discover this fact
until early the next morning.</p>

<div id="ip_25b" class="figright" style="width: 203px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Col Michael P. Ryan, USMC, wears the

  <img src="images/i_025a.jpg" width="203" height="256" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On Betio, Shoup was pleased to
receive at 1415 an unexpected report
from Major Ryan that several
hundred Marines and a pair of tanks
had penetrated 500 yards beyond Red
Beach One on the western end of the
island. This was by far the most successful
progress of the day, and the
news was doubly welcome because
Shoup, fearing the worst, had assumed
Schoettel’s companies and the
other strays who had veered in that
direction had been wiped out.
Shoup, however, was unable to convey
the news to Smith.</p>

<p>Ryan’s composite troops had indeed
been successful on the western
end. Learning quickly how best to
operate with the medium tanks, the
Marines carved out a substantial
beachhead, overrunning many
Japanese turrets and pillboxes. But
aside from the tanks, Ryan’s men had
nothing but infantry weapons. Critically,
they had no flamethrowers or
demolitions. Ryan had learned from
earlier experience in the Solomons
that “positions reduced only with
grenades could come alive again.” By
late afternoon, he decided to pull
back his thin lines and consolidate.
“I was convinced that without
flamethrowers or explosives to clean
them out we had to pull back ...
to a perimeter that could be defended
against counterattack by Japanese
troops still hidden in the bunkers.”</p>

<p>The fundamental choice faced by
most other Marines on Betio that day
was whether to stay put along the
beach or crawl over the seawall and
carry the fight inland. For much of
the day the fire coming across the top
of those coconut logs was so intense
it seemed “a man could lift his hand
and get it shot off.” Late on D-Day,
there were many too demoralized to
advance. When Major Rathvon
McC. Tompkins, bearing messages
from General Hermle to Colonel
Shoup, first arrived on Red Beach
Two at the foot of the pier at dusk
on D-Day, he was appalled at the
sight of so many stragglers. Tompkins
wondered why the Japanese
“didn’t use mortars on the first night.
People were lying on the beach so
thick you couldn’t walk.”</p>

<p>Conditions were congested on Red
Beach One, as well, but there was a
difference. Major Crowe was everywhere,
“as cool as ice box lettuce.”
There were no stragglers. Crowe
constantly fed small groups of Marines
into the lines to reinforce his
precarious hold on the left flank.
Captain Hoffman of 3/8 was not displeased
to find his unit suddenly integrated
within Crowe’s 2/8. And
Crowe certainly needed help as darkness
began to fall. “There we were,”
Hoffman recalled, “toes in the water,
casualties everywhere, dead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
wounded all around us. But finally
a few Marines started inching forward,
a yard here, a yard there.” It
was enough. Hoffman was soon able
to see well enough to call in naval
gunfire support 50 yards ahead. His
Marines dug in for the night.</p>

<p>West of Crowe’s lines, and just inland
from Shoup’s command post,
Captain William T. Bray’s Company
B, 1/2, settled in for the expected
counterattacks. The company had
been scattered in Kyle’s bloody landing
at mid-day. Bray reported to Kyle
that he had men from 12 to 14 different
units in his company, including
several sailors who swam ashore
from sinking boats. The men were
well armed and no longer strangers
to each other, and Kyle was
reassured.</p>

<p>Altogether, some 5,000 Marines
had stormed the beaches of Betio on
D-Day. Fifteen hundred of these were
dead, wounded, or missing by nightfall.
The survivors held less than a
quarter of a square mile of sand and
coral. Shoup later described the location
of his beachhead lines the
night of D-Day as “a stock market
graph.” His Marines went to ground
in the best fighting positions they
could secure, whether in shellholes
inland or along the splintered seawall.
Despite the crazy-quilt defensive
positions and scrambled units,
the Marines’ fire discipline was superb.
The troops seemed to share a
certain grim confidence; they had
faced the worst in getting ashore.
They were quietly ready for any sudden
<i>banzai</i> charges in the dark.</p>

<p>Offshore, the level of confidence
diminished. General Julian Smith on
<i>Maryland</i> was gravely concerned.
“This was the crisis of the battle,” he
recalled. “Three-fourths of the Island
was in the enemy’s hands, and even
allowing for his losses he should have
had as many troops left as we had
ashore.” A concerted Japanese counterattack,
Smith believed, would
have driven most of his forces into
the sea. Smith and Hill reported up
the chain of command to Turner,
Spruance, and Nimitz: “Issue remains
in doubt.” Spruance’s staff began
drafting plans for emergency evacuation
of the landing force.</p>

<p>The expected Japanese counterattack
did not materialize. The principal
dividend of all the
bombardment turned out to be the
destruction of Admiral Shibasaki’s
wire communications. The Japanese
commander could not muster his
men to take the offensive. A few individuals
infiltrated through the Marine
lines to swim out to disabled
tanks and LVTs in the lagoon, where
they waited for the morning. Otherwise,
all was quiet.</p>

<p>The main struggle throughout the
night of D-Day was the attempt by
Shoup and Hermle to advise Julian
Smith of the best place to land the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
reserves on D+1. Smith was amazed
to learn at 0200 that Hall and Hays
were in fact not ashore but still afloat
at the line of departure, awaiting orders.
Again, he ordered Combat Team
Eight (-) to land on the eastern tip of
the island, this time at 0900 on D+1.
Hermle finally caught a boat to one
of the destroyers in the lagoon to relay
Shoup’s request to the commanding
general to land reinforcements on
Red Beach Two. Smith altered Hall’s
orders accordingly, but he ordered
Hermle back to the flagship, miffed
at his assistant for not getting ashore
and taking command. But Hermle
had done Smith a good service in
relaying the advice from Shoup. As
much as the 8th Marines were going
to bleed in the morning’s assault, a
landing on the eastern end of the island
would have been an unmitigated
catastrophe. Reconnaissance after
the battle discovered those beaches
to be the most intensely mined on the
island.</p>

<p class="drop-cap redcap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> LVT-2, popularly known as the Water Buffalo,
was built to improve upon shortcomings in the
design of the Marine Corps’ initial amphibian vehicle,
the LVT-1. The new vehicle featured a redesigned suspension
system with rubber-tired road wheels and torsion
springs for improved stability and a smoother ride. The
power train was standardized with that of the M3A1 Stuart
light tank. This gave the LVT-2 greater power and reliability
than its predecessor and, combined with new
“W”-shaped treads, gave it greater propulsion on land and
in the water. The new vehicle also could carry 1,500 pounds
more cargo than the original LVT-1.</p>

  <div class="captionl">

<p><i>LVT-2 comes ashore on Green Beach on approximately D+2</i></p></div></div>

<p>The LVT-2 entered production in June 1942, but did not
see combat until Tarawa in November 1943. The Marines
used a combination of LVT-1s and LVT-2s in the assault on
Betio. The 50 LVT-2s used at Tarawa were modified in
Samoa just before the battle with 3/8-inch boiler plates installed
around the cab for greater protection from small
arms fire and shell fragments. Despite the loss of 30 of these
vehicles to enemy fire at Tarawa, the improvised armor was
considered promising and led to a call for truly armored
LVTs.</p>

<p>The LVT(A)2 [“A” for armored] requested by the U.S.
Army was a version which saw limited use with the Marine
Corps. The LVT(A)2 had factory-installed armor plating
on the hull and cab to resist heavy machine gun fire.
The new version appeared identical to the LVT-2 with the
exception of armored drivers’ hatches. With legitimate armor
protection, the LVT(A)2 could function as an assault
vehicle in the lead waves of a landing. The armored amphibian
vehicle provided excellent service when it was introduced
to Marine operations on New Britain.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 LVT-2s and LVT(A)2s were manufactured
during World War II. These combat vehicles proved
to be valuable assets to Marine Corps assault teams
throughout the Pacific campaign, transporting thousands
of troops and tons of equipment. The overall design,
however, left some operational deficiencies. For one thing,
the vehicles lacked a ramp. All troops and equipment had
to be loaded and unloaded over the gunwales. This caused
problems in normal field use and was particularly
hazardous during an opposed landing. This factor would
lead to the further development of amphibian tractors in
the LVT family during the war.</p>

<h3 title="‘The Singapore Guns’" class="nobreak p0 black">‘The Singapore Guns’</h3>

<p class="drop-cap redcap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> firing on Betio had barely subsided before
apocryphal claims began to appear in print that
the four eight-inch naval rifles used as coastal
defense guns by the Japanese were the same ones captured
from the British at the fall of Singapore. Many prominent
historians unwittingly perpetuated this story, among them
the highly respected Samuel Eliot Morison.</p>

<p>In 1977, however, British writer William H. Bartsch published
the results of a recent visit to Tarawa in the quarterly
magazine <i>After the Battle</i>. Bartsch personally examined
each of the four guns and discovered markings indicating
manufacture by Vickers, the British ordnance company. The
Vickers company subsequently provided Bartsch records
indicating the four guns were part of a consignment of 12
eight-inch, quick-firing guns which were sold in 1905 to
the Japanese during their war with Russia. Further investigation
by Bartsch at the Imperial War Museum produced
the fact that there were no eight-inch guns captured by the
Japanese at Singapore. In short, the guns at Tarawa came
from a far more legitimate, and older, transaction with the
British.</p>

<p>The eight-inch guns fired the opening rounds in the battle
of Tarawa, but were not by themselves a factor in the
contest. Earlier bombing raids may have damaged their fire
control systems. Rapid counterbattery fire from American
battleships took out the big guns in short order, although
one of them maintained an intermittent, if inaccurate, fire
throughout D+1. Colonel Shoup stated emphatically that
the 2d Marine Division was fully aware of the presence of
eight-inch guns on Betio as early as mid-August 1943. By
contrast, the division intelligence annex to Shoup’s operation
order, updated nine days before the landing, discounts
external reports that the main guns were likely to be as large
as eight-inch, insisting instead that “they are probably not
more than 6-inch.” Prior knowledge notwithstanding, the
fact remains that many American officers were unpleasantly
surprised to experience major caliber near-misses bracketing
the amphibious task force early on D-Day.</p>

<h3 title="Sherman Medium Tanks at Tarawa" class="nobreak p0 black">Sherman Medium Tanks at Tarawa</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> company of M4-A2 Sherman medium tanks
was assigned to the 2d Marine Division for
Operation Galvanic from the I Marine Amphibious
Corps. The 14 tanks deployed from Noumea in early
November 1943, on board the new dock landing ship <i>Ashland</i>
(LSD 1), joining Task Force 53 enroute to the Gilberts.
Each 34-ton, diesel-powered Sherman was operated by a
crew of five and featured a gyro-stabilized 75mm gun and
three machine guns. Regrettably, the Marines had no opportunity
to operate with their new offensive assets until
the chaos of D-Day at Betio.</p>

C, Medium Tanks, was disabled inland from Red Beach
Three by mutually supporting Japanese antitank guns firing
from well-dug in positions not too far from the beaches.</i></p></div></div>

<p>The Shermans joined Wave 5 of the ship-to-shore assault.
The tanks negotiated the gauntlet of Japanese fire without
incident, but five were lost when they plunged into unseen
shell craters in the turbid water. Ashore, the Marines’ lack
of operating experience with medium tanks proved costly
to the survivors. Local commanders simply ordered the vehicles
inland to attack targets of opportunity unsupported.
All but two were soon knocked out of action.
Enterprising salvage crews worked throughout each night
to cannibalize severely damaged vehicles in order to keep
other tanks operational. Meanwhile, the Marines learned
to employ the tanks within an integrated team of covering
infantry and engineers. The Shermans then proved invaluable
in Major Ryan’s seizure of Green Beach on D+1, the
attacks of Major Jones and Major Crowe on D+2, and the
final assault by Lieutenant Colonel McLeod on D+3. Early
in the battle, Japanese 75mm antitank guns were deadly
against the Shermans, but once these weapons were
destroyed, the defenders could do little more than shoot
out the periscopes with sniper fire.</p>

<p>Colonel Shoup’s opinion of the medium tanks was ambivalent.
His disappointment in the squandered deployment
and heavy losses among the Shermans on D-Day was tempered
by subsequent admiration for their tactical role ashore.
Time and again, Japanese emplacements of reinforced
concrete, steel, and sand were reduced by direct fire
from the tanks’ main guns, despite a “prohibitive ammunition
expenditure.” Shoup also reported that “the so-called
crushing effect of medium tanks, as a tactical measure, was
practically negligible in this operation, and I believe no one
should place any faith in eliminating fortifications by running
over them with a tank.”</p>

<p>The Marines agreed that the advent of the Shermans rendered
their light tanks obsolete. “Medium tanks are just
as easy to get ashore, and they pack greater armor and firepower,”
concluded one battalion commander. By the war’s
end, the American ordnance industry had manufactured
48,064 Sherman tanks for employment by the U.S. Army
and Marine Corps in all theaters of combat.

<h2><a name="D1_at_Betio" id="D1_at_Betio"></a><i>D+1 at Betio,</i><br />
<i>21 November 1943</i></h2>


<p>The tactical situation on Betio remained
precarious for much of the
2d day. Throughout the morning, the
Marines paid dearly for every attempt
to land reserves or advance
their ragged beachheads.</p>

<p>The reef and beaches of Tarawa already
looked like a charnel house.
Lieutenant Lillibridge surveyed what
he could see of the beach at first light
and was appalled: “... a dreadful
sight, bodies drifting slowly in the
water just off the beach, junked amtracks.”
The stench of dead bodies covered
the embattled island like a
cloud. The smell drifted out to the
line of departure, a bad omen for the
troops of 1st Battalion, 8th Marines,
getting ready to start their run to the
beach.</p>

<p>Colonel Shoup, making the most
of faulty communications and imperfect
knowledge of his scattered forces,
ordered each landing team commander
to attack: Kyle and Jordan
to seize the south coast, Crowe and
Ruud to reduce Japanese strongholds
to their left and front, Ryan to seize
all of Green Beach. Shoup’s predawn
request to General Smith, relayed
through Major Tompkins and General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Hermle, specified the landing of
Hays’ LT 1/8 on Red Beach Two
“<i>close to the pier</i>.” That key component
of Shoup’s request did not survive
the tenuous communications
route to Smith. The commanding
general simply ordered Colonel Hall
and Major Hays to land on Red Two
at 0615. Hall and Hays, oblivious of
the situation ashore, assumed 1/8
would be making a covered landing.</p>

<p><i>“The Wave Breaks on the Beach,” a sketch by Kerr Eby. The scene represents the unwelcome
greeting received by LT 1/8 off Red Beach Two on the morning of D+1.</i></p></div></div>

<p>The Marines of LT 1/8 had spent
the past 18 hours embarked in
LCVPs. During one of the endless circles
that night, Chaplain W. Wyeth
Willard passed Colonel Hall’s boat
and yelled, “What are they saving us
for, the Junior Prom?” The troops
cheered when the boats finally
turned for the beach.</p>

<p>Things quickly went awry. The
dodging tides again failed to provide
sufficient water for the boats to cross
the reef. Hays’ men, surprised at the
obstacle, began the 500-yard trek to
shore, many of them dangerously far
to the right flank, fully within the
beaten zone of the multiple guns firing
from the re-entrant strongpoint.
“It was the worst possible place they
could have picked,” said “Red Mike”
Edson. Japanese gunners opened an
unrelenting fire. Enfilade fire came
from snipers who had infiltrated to
the disabled LVTs offshore during the
night. At least one machine gun
opened up on the wading troops
from the beached inter-island
schooner <i>Niminoa</i> at the reef’s edge.
Hays’ men began to fall at every
hand.</p>

<p>The Marines on the beach did
everything they could to stop the
slaughter. Shoup called for naval
gunfire support. Two of Lieutenant
Colonel Rixey’s 75mm pack howitzers
(protected by a sand berm erected
during the night by a Seabee
bulldozer) began firing at the blockhouses
at the Red 1/Red 2 border,
125 yards away, with delayed fuses
and high explosive shells. A flight of
F4F Wildcats attacked the hulk of the
<i>Niminoa</i> with bombs and machine
guns. These measures helped, but for
the large part the Japanese caught
Hays’ lead waves in a withering
crossfire.</p>

<div id="ip_28b" class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Readily disassembled and reassembled, the 75mm pack howitzers of 1st Battalion,

provided outstanding fire support at exceptionally short ranges to the infantry.</i></p>

<p>Correspondent Robert Sherrod
watched the bloodbath in horror.
“One boat blows up, then another.
The survivors start swimming for
shore, but machine gun bullets dot
the water all around them.... This
is worse, far worse than it was yesterday.”
Within an hour, Sherrod could
count “at least two hundred bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
which do not move at all on the dry
flats.”</p>

<p><i>Navy medical personnel evacuate the wounded from the beachhead on D-Day. This
was difficult because there were few places anywhere that Marines could walk upright.
The shortage of stretchers compounded the problems of the landing force.</i></p></div></div>

<p>First Lieutenant Dean Ladd was
shot in the stomach shortly after
jumping into the water from his boat.
Recalling the strict orders to the
troops not to stop for the wounded,
Ladd expected to die on the spot.
One of his riflemen, Private First
Class T.&nbsp;F. Sullivan, ignored the orders
and saved his lieutenant’s life.
Ladd’s rifle platoon suffered 12 killed
and 12 wounded during the ship-to-shore
assault.</p>

<p>First Lieutenant Frank Plant, the
battalion air liaison officer, accompanied
Major Hays in the command
LCVP. As the craft slammed into the
reef, Plant recalled Hays shouting
“Men, debark!” as he jumped into the
water. The troops that followed were
greeted by a murderous fire. Plant
helped pull the wounded back into
the boat, noting that “the water all
around was colored purple with
blood.” As Plant hurried to catch up
with Major Hays, he was terrified at
the sudden appearance of what he
took to be Japanese fighters roaring
right towards him. These were the
Navy Wildcats aiming for the nearby
<i>Niminoa</i>. The pilots were exuberant
but inconsistent: one bomb hit
the hulk squarely; others missed by
200 yards. An angry David Shoup
came up on the radio: “Stop strafing!
Bombing ship hitting own troops!”</p>

<p>At the end, it was the sheer
courage of the survivors that got
them ashore under such a hellish
crossfire. Hays reported to Shoup at
0800 with about half his landing
team. He had suffered more than 300
casualties; others were scattered all
along the beach and the pier. Worse,
the unit had lost all its flamethrowers,
demolitions, and heavy
weapons. Shoup directed Hays to attack
westward, but both men knew
that small arms and courage alone
would not prevail against fortified
positions.</p>

<p>Shoup tried not to let his discouragement
show, but admitted in
a message to General Smith “the situation
does not look good ashore.”</p>

<p>The combined forces of Majors
Crowe and Ruud on Red Beach
Three were full of fight and had
plenty of weapons. But their left
flank was flush against three large
Japanese bunkers, each mutually
supporting, and seemingly unassailable.
The stubby Burns-Philp commercial
pier, slightly to the east of the
main pier, became a bloody “no-man’s
land” as the forces fought for
its possession. Learning from the
mistakes of D-Day, Crowe insured
that his one surviving Sherman tank
was always accompanied by infantry.</p>

<p>Crowe and Ruud benefitted from
intensive air support and naval gunfire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
along their left flank. Crowe was
unimpressed with the accuracy and
effectiveness of the aviators (“our aircraft
never did us much good”), but
he was enthusiastic about the naval
guns. “I had the <i>Ringgold</i>, the
<i>Dashiell</i>, and the <i>Anderson</i> in support
of me.... Anything I asked
for I got from them. They were
great!” On one occasion on D+1,
Crowe authorized direct fire from a
destroyer in the lagoon at a large
command bunker only 50 yards
ahead of the Marines. “They
slammed them in there and you
could see arms and legs and everything
just go up like that!”</p>

the long pier to begin the assault.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Inland from Red Beach Two, Kyle
and Jordan managed to get some of
their troops across the fire-swept airstrip
and all the way to the south
coast, a significant penetration. The
toehold was precarious, however,
and the Marines sustained heavy
casualties. “You could not see the
Japanese,” recalled Lieutenant Lillibridge,
“but fire seemed to come
from every direction.” When Jordan
lost contact with his lead elements,
Shoup ordered him across the island
to reestablish command. Jordan did
so at great hazard. By the time Kyle
arrived, Jordan realized his own
presence was superfluous. Only 50
men could be accounted for of LT
2/2’s rifle companies. Jordan organized
and supplied these survivors
to the best of his abilities, then&mdash;at
Shoup’s direction&mdash;merged them
with Kyle’s force and stepped back
into his original role as an observer.</p>

<p>The 2d Marines’ Scout Sniper Platoon
had been spectacularly heroic
from the very start when they led the
assault on the pier just before H-Hour.
Lieutenant Hawkins continuously
set an example of cool disdain
for danger in every tactical situation.
His bravery was superhuman, but it
could not last in the maelstrom. He
was wounded by a Japanese mortar
shell on D-Day, but shook off attempts
to treat his injuries. At dawn
on D+1 he led his men in attacking
a series of strongpoints firing on LT
1/8 in the water. Hawkins crawled
directly up to a major pillbox, fired
his weapon point blank through the
gun ports, then threw grenades inside
to complete the job. He was shot in
the chest, but continued the attack,
personally taking out three more pillboxes.
Then a Japanese shell nearly
tore him apart. It was a mortal
wound. The division mourned his
death. Hawkins was awarded the
Medal of Honor posthumously. Said
Colonel Shoup, “It’s not often that
you can credit a first lieutenant with
winning a battle, but Hawkins came
as near to it as any man could.”</p>

<p>It was up to Major Mike Ryan and
his makeshift battalion on the
western end of Betio to make the biggest
contribution to winning the battle
on D+1. Ryan’s fortunes had been
greatly enhanced by three developments
during the night: the absence
of a Japanese spoiling attack against
his thin lines, the repair of the medium
tank “Cecilia,” and the arrival of
Lieutenant Thomas Greene, USN, a
naval gunfire spotter with a fully
functional radio. Ryan took his time
organizing a coordinated attack
against the nest of gun emplacements,
pillboxes, and rifle pits concentrated
on the southwest corner of
the island. He was slowed by another
failure in communications. Ryan
could talk to the fire support ships
but not to Shoup. It seemed to Ryan
that it took hours for his runners to
negotiate the gauntlet of fire back to
the beach, radio Shoup’s CP, and
return with answers. Ryan’s first message
to Shoup announcing his attack
plans received the eventual response,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
“Hold up&mdash;we are calling an air
strike.” It took two more runners to
get the air strike cancelled. Ryan then
ordered Lieutenant Greene to call in
naval gunfire on the southwest targets.
Two destroyers in the lagoon
responded quickly and accurately. At
1120, Ryan launched a coordinated
tank-infantry assault. Within the
hour his patchwork force had seized
all of Green Beach and was ready to
attack eastward toward the airfield.</p>

<p><i>Navy hospital corpsmen attend a critically wounded Marine on Betio. The 2d Marine
Division’s organic medical personnel paid a high price while administering aid
to fallen Marines: 30 Navy doctors and corpsmen were killed; another 59 wounded.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Communications were still terrible.
For example, Ryan twice reported
the southern end of Green Beach
to be heavily mined, a message that
never reached any higher headquarters.
But General Smith on board
<i>Maryland</i> did receive direct word of
Ryan’s success and was overjoyed. For
the first time Smith had the opportunity
to land reinforcements on a covered
beach with their unit integrity
intact.</p>

<p>General Smith and “Red Mike” Edson
had been conferring that morning
with Colonel Maurice G.
Holmes, commanding the 6th Marines,
as to the best means of getting
the fresh combat team ashore. In
view of the heavy casualties sustained
by Hays’ battalion on Red
Beach Two, Smith was reconsidering
a landing on the unknown eastern
end of the island. The good news
from Ryan quickly solved the
problem. Smith ordered Holmes to
land one battalion by rubber rafts on
Green Beach, with a second landing
team boated in LCVPs prepared to
wade ashore in support.</p>

<p>At this time Smith received reports
that Japanese troops were escaping
from the eastern end of Betio by
wading across to Bairiki, the next island.
The Marines did not want to
fight the same tenacious enemy
twice. Smith then ordered Holmes to
land one battalion on Bairiki to “seal
the back door.” Holmes assigned
Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L.
Murray to land 2/6 on Bairiki, Major
“Willie K.” Jones to land 1/6 by rubber
boat on Green Beach, and Lieutenant
Colonel Kenneth F. McLeod to
be prepared to land 3/6 at any assigned
spot, probably Green Beach.
Smith also ordered the light tanks of
Company B, 2d Tank Battalion, to
land on Green Beach in support of
the 6th Marines.</p>

<p>These tactical plans took much
longer to execute than envisioned.
Jones was ready to debark from
<i>Feland</i> (APA 11) when the ship was
suddenly ordered underway to avoid
a perceived submarine threat. Hours
passed before the ship could return
close enough to Betio to launch the
rubber boats and their LCVP tow
craft. The light tanks were among the
few critical items not truly combat
loaded in their transports, being carried
in the very bottom of the cargo
holds. Indiscriminate unloading during
the first 30 hours of the landing
had further scrambled supplies and
equipment in intervening decks. It
took hours to get the tanks clear and
loaded on board lighters.</p>

<p>Shoup was bewildered by the long
delays. At 1345 he sent Jones a message:
“Bring in flamethrowers if possible....
Doing our best.” At 1525
he queried division about the estimated
landing time of LT 1/6. He
wanted Jones ashore and on the attack
before dark.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shoup and his small
staff were beset by logistic support
problems. Already there were teams
organized to strip the dead of their
ammunition, canteens, and first aid
pouches. Lieutenant Colonel Carlson
helped organize a “false beachhead”
at the end of the pier. Most progress
came from the combined efforts of
Lieutenant Colonel Chester J. Salazar,
commanding the shore party;
Captain John B. McGovern, USN,
acting as primary control officer on
board the minesweeper <i>Pursuit</i> (AM
108); Major Ben K. Weatherwax, assistant
division D-4; and Major George
L.&nbsp;H. Cooper, operations officer
of 2d Battalion, 18th Marines.
Among them, these officers gradually
brought some order out of chaos.
They assumed strict control of supplies
unloaded and used the surviving
LVTs judiciously to keep the
shuttle of casualties moving seaward
and critical items from the pierhead
to the beach. All of this was performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
by sleepless men under constant
fire.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

  <div class="captionl">

<p><i>This desperate scene hardly needs a caption. The Marine is badly hurt, but he’s
in good hands as his buddies lead him to safety and shelter just ahead for treatment.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Casualty handling was the most
pressing logistic problem on D+1.
The 2d Marine Division was heroically
served at Tarawa by its organic
Navy doctors and hospital
corpsmen. Nearly 90 of these medical
specialists were themselves casualties
in the fighting ashore. Lieutenant
Herman R. Brukhardt, Medical
Corps, USN, established an emergency
room in a freshly captured
Japanese bunker (some of whose
former occupants “came to life” with
blazing rifles more than once). In 36
hours, under brutal conditions,
Brukhardt treated 126 casualties;
only four died.</p>

<p>At first, casualties were evacuated
to troopships far out in the transport
area. The long journey was dangerous
to the wounded troops and
wasteful of the few available LVTs or
LCVPs. The Marines then began
delivering casualties to the destroyer
<i>Ringgold</i> in the lagoon, even
though her sickbay had been
wrecked by a Japanese five-inch shell
on D-Day. The ship, still actively firing
support missions, accepted
dozens of casualties and did her best.
Admiral Hill then took the risk of
dispatching the troopship <i>Doyen</i>
(APA 1) into the lagoon early on
D+1 for service as primary receiving
ship for critical cases. Lieutenant
Commander James Oliver, MC,
USN, led a five-man surgical team
with recent combat experience in the
Aleutians. In the next three days
Oliver’s team treated more than 550
severely wounded Marines. “We ran
out of sodium pentathol and had to
use ether,” said Oliver, “although a
bomb hit would have blown <i>Doyen</i>
off the face of the planet.”</p>

<p>Navy chaplains were also hard at
work wherever Marines were fighting
ashore. Theirs was particularly
heartbreaking work, consoling the
wounded, administering last rites to
the dying, praying for the souls of the
dead before the bulldozer came to
cover the bodies from the unforgiving
tropical sun.</p>

<div id="ip_32b" class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">

  <img src="images/i_032a.jpg" width="431" height="327" alt="" />
</div>


<p>The tide of battle began to shift
perceptibly towards the Americans
by mid-afternoon on D+1. The fighting
was still intense, the Japanese fire
still murderous, but the surviving
Marines were on the move, no longer
gridlocked in precarious toeholds on
the beach. Rixey’s pack howitzers
were adding a new definition for
close fire support. The supply of ammunition
and fresh water was greatly
improved. Morale was up, too.
The troops knew the 6th Marines
was coming in soon. “I thought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
until 1300 today it was touch and go,”
said Rixey, “then I knew we would
win.”</p>

<p>By contrast, a sense of despair
seemed to spread among the
defenders. They had shot down the
Marines at every turn, but with every
fallen Marine, another would appear,
rifle blazing, well supported by
artillery and naval guns. The great
<i>Yogaki</i> plan seemed a bust. Only a
few aircraft attacked the island each
night; the transports were never seriously
threatened. The Japanese fleet
never materialized. Increasingly,
Japanese troops began committing
suicide rather than risk capture.</p>

<p>Shoup sensed this shift in momentum.
Despite his frustration over the
day’s delays and miscommunications,
he was buoyed enough to send a 1600
situation report to Julian Smith,
which closed with these terse words
that became a classic: “Casualties:
many. Percentage dead: unknown.
Combat efficiency: <i>We are winning</i>.”</p>

<p>At 1655, Murray’s 2/6 landed
against light opposition on Bairiki.
During the night and early morning
hours, Lieutenant Colonel George
Shell’s 2d Battalion, 10th Marines,
landed on the same island and began
registering its howitzers. Rixey’s fire
direction center on Betio helped this
process, while the artillery forward
observer attached to Crowe’s LT 2/8
on Red Beach One had the unusual
experience of adjusting the fire of the
Bairiki guns “while looking into their
muzzles.” The Marines had practiced
this earlier on New Zealand. Smith
finally had artillery in place on
Bairiki.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Major Jones and LT
1/6 were finally on the move. It had
been a day of many false starts. At
one point, Jones and his men had
been debarking over the sides in
preparation for an assault on the
eastern end of the Betio when “The
Word” changed their mission to
Green Beach. When <i>Feland</i> finally
returned to within reasonable range
from the island, the Marines of LT
1/6 disembarked for real. Using tactics
developed with the Navy during
the Efate rehearsal, the Marines loaded
on board LCVPs which towed
their rubber rafts to the reef. There
the Marines embarked on board their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
rafts, six to 10 troops per craft, and
began the 1,000-yard paddle towards
Green Beach.</p>

<i>(AKA 20) to begin the 1,000-yard trek towards Green Beach the evening of D+1.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Major Jones remarked that he did
not feel like “The Admiral of the
Condom Fleet” as he helped paddle
his raft shoreward. “Control was
nebulous at best ... the battalion
was spread out over the ocean from
horizon to horizon. We must have
had 150 boats.” Jones was alarmed at
the frequent appearance of antiboat
mines moored to coralheads beneath
the surface. The rubber rafts passed
over the mines without incident, but
Jones also had two LVTs accompanying
his ship-to-shore movement, each
preloaded with ammo, rations,
water, medical supplies, and spare radio
equipment. Guided by the rafts,
one of the LVTs made it ashore, but
the second drifted into a mine which
blew the heavy vehicle 10 feet into
the air, killing most of the crew and
destroying the supplies. It was a serious
loss, but not critical. Well covered
by Ryan’s men, the landing
force suffered no other casualties
coming ashore. Jones’ battalion became
the first to land on Betio essentially
intact.</p>

<p>It was after dark by the time Jones’
troops assumed defensive positions
behind Ryan’s lines. The light tanks
of Company B continued their attempt
to come ashore on Green
Beach, but the high surf and great
distance between the reef and the
beach greatly hindered landing efforts.
Eventually, a platoon of six
tanks managed to reach the beach;
the remainder of the company moved
its boats toward the pier and worked
all night to get ashore on Red Beach
Two. McLeod’s LT 3/6 remained
afloat in LCVPs beyond the reef, facing
an uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>That evening Shoup turned to
Robert Sherrod and stated, “Well, I
think we’re winning, but the bastards
have got a lot of bullets left. I think
we’ll clean up tomorrow.”</p>

<p>After dark, General Smith sent his
chief of staff, “Red Mike” Edson,
ashore to take command of all forces
on Betio and Bairiki. Shoup had
done a magnificent job, but it was
time for the senior colonel to take
charge. There were now eight reinforced
infantry battalions and two
artillery battalions deployed on the
two islands. With LT 3/6 scheduled
to land early on D+2, virtually all
the combat and combat support elements
of the 2d Marine Division
would be deployed.</p>

<p>Edson reached Shoup’s CP by 2030
and found the barrel-chested warrior
still on his feet, grimy and haggard,
but full of fight. Edson assumed
command, allowing Shoup to concentrate
on his own reinforced combat
team, and began making
plans for the morning.</p>

<p>Years later, General Julian Smith
looked back on the pivotal day of 21
November 1943 at Betio and admitted,
“we were losing until we won!”
Many things had gone wrong, and
the Japanese had inflicted severe
casualties on the attackers, but, from
this point on, the issue was no longer
in doubt at Tarawa.</p>

<p class="drop-cap redcap al"><span class="smcap1">An</span> excerpt from the field notebook
David Shoup carried
during the battle of Tarawa
reveals a few aspects of the personality
of its enigmatic author: “If you are qualified,
fate has a way of getting you to the
right place at the right time&mdash;tho’ sometimes
it appears to be a long, long wait.”
For Shoup, the former farm boy from
Battle Ground, Indiana, the combination
of time and place worked to his
benefit on two momentous occasions, at
Tarawa in 1943, and as President Dwight
D. Eisenhower’s deep selection to become
22d Commandant of the Marine Corps
in 1959.</p>

  <div class="captionl">

<p><i>Col David M. Shoup, here as he appeared
after the battle, was the fourth
and only living Marine awarded a Medal
of Honor from the Tarawa fighting.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Colonel Shoup was 38 at the time of
Tarawa, and he had been a Marine
officer since 1926. Unlike such colorful
contemporaries as Merritt Edson and
Evans Carlson, Shoup had limited prior
experience as a commander and only
brief exposure to combat. Then came
Tarawa, where Shoup, the junior colonel
in the 2d Marine Division, commanded
eight battalion landing teams in some of
the most savage fighting of the war.</p>

<p><i>Time</i> correspondent Robert Sherrod
recorded his first impression of Shoup
enroute to Betio: “He was an interesting
character, this Colonel Shoup. A squat,
red-faced man with a bull neck, a hard-boiled,
profane shouter of orders, he
would carry the biggest burden on Tarawa.”
Another contemporary described
Shoup as “a Marine’s Marine,” a leader
the troops “could go to the well with.”
First Sergeant Edward G. Doughman,
who served with Shoup in China and in
the Division Operations section,
described him as “the brainiest, nerviest,
best soldiering Marine I ever met.” It is
no coincidence that Shoup also was considered
the most formidable poker player
in the division, a man with eyes “like
two burn holes in a blanket.”</p>

<p>Part of Colonel Shoup’s Medal of
Honor citation reflects his strength of
character:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Upon arrival at the shore, he assumed
command of all landed
troops and, working without rest
under constant withering enemy
fire during the next two days, conducted
smashing attacks against
unbelievably strong and fanatically
defended Japanese positions
despite innumerable obstacles and
heavy casualties.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shoup was modest about his achievements.
Another entry in his 1943 notebook
contains this introspection, “I
realize that I am but a bit of chaff from
the threshings of life blown into the
pages of history by the unknown winds
of chance.”</p>

<p>David Shoup died on 13 January 1983
at age 78 and was buried in Arlington
National Cemetery. “In his private life,”
noted the <i>Washington Post</i> obituary,
“General Shoup was a poet.”

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="The_Third_Day" id="The_Third_Day"></a><i>The Third Day:<br />
D+2 at Betio,<br />
22 November 1943</i></h2>


<p>On D+2, <i>Chicago Daily News</i> war
correspondent Keith Wheeler
released this dispatch from Tarawa:
“It looks as though the Marines are
winning on this blood-soaked,
bomb-hammered, stinking little
abattoir of an island.”</p>

<p>Colonel Edson issued his attack
orders at 0400. As recorded in the division’s
D-3 journal, Edson’s plan for
D+2 was this: “1/6 attacks at 0800
to the east along south beach to establish
contact with 1/2 and 2/2. 1/8
attached to 2dMar attacks at daylight
to the west along north beach to
eliminate Jap pockets of resistance
between Beaches Red 1 and 2.
8th Mar (-LT 1/8) continues attack to
east.” Edson also arranged for naval
gunfire and air support to strike the
eastern end of the island at 20-minute
interludes throughout the morning,
beginning at 0700. McLeod’s LT 3/6,
still embarked at the line of departure,
would land at Shoup’s call on
Green Beach.</p>

<p>The key to the entire plan was the
eastward attack by the fresh troops
of Major Jones’ landing team, but Edson
was unable for hours to raise the
1st Battalion, 6th Marines, on any
radio net. The enterprising Major
Tompkins, assistant division operations
officer, volunteered to deliver
the attack order personally to Major
Jones. Tompkins’ hair-raising odyssey
from Edson’s CP to Green Beach
took nearly three hours, during
which time he was nearly shot on
several occasions by nervous
Japanese and American sentries. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
quirk, the radio nets started working
again just before Tompkins
reached LT 1/6. Jones had the good
grace not to admit to Tompkins that
he already had the attack order when
the exhausted messenger arrived.</p>

<p>On Red Beach Two, Major Hays
launched his attack promptly at
0700, attacking westward on a three-company
front. Engineers with satchel
charges and Bangalore torpedoes
helped neutralize several inland
Japanese positions, but the strongpoints
along the re-entrant were still
as dangerous as hornets’ nests. Marine
light tanks made brave frontal
attacks against the fortifications,
even firing their 37mm guns point-blank
into the embrasures, but they
were inadequate for the task. One
was lost to enemy fire, and the other
two were withdrawn. Hays called for
a section of 75mm halftracks. One
was lost almost immediately, but the
other used its heavier gun to considerable
advantage. The center and
left flank companies managed to
curve around behind the main complexes,
effectively cutting the
Japanese off from the rest of the island.
Along the beach, however,
progress was measured in yards. The
bright spot of the day for 1/8 came
late in the afternoon when a small
party of Japanese tried a sortie from
the strongpoints against the Marine
lines. Hays’ men, finally given real
targets in the open, cut down the attackers
in short order.</p>

<p>On Green Beach, Major Jones
made final preparations for the assault
of 1/6 to the east. Although
there were several light tanks available
from the platoon which came
ashore the previous evening, Jones
preferred the insurance of medium
tanks. Majors “Willie K.” Jones and
“Mike” Ryan were good friends; Jones
prevailed on their friendship to “borrow”
Ryan’s two battle-scarred Shermans
for the assault. Jones ordered
the tanks to range no further than 50
yards ahead of his lead company, and
he personally maintained radio contact
with the tank commander. Jones
also assigned a platoon of water-cooled
.30-caliber machine guns to
each rifle company and attached his
combat engineers with their flame
throwers and demolition squads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the lead company. The nature of the
terrain and the necessity for giving
Hays’ battalion wide berth made
Jones constrain his attack to a platoon
front in a zone of action only
100 yards wide. “It was the most unusual
tactics that I ever heard of,”
recalled Jones. “As I moved to the east
on one side of the airfield, Larry
Hays moved to the west, exactly opposite....
I was attacking towards
Wood Kyle who had 1st Battalion,
2d Marines.”</p>

Marine Division used as high-priced courier by Shoup, rests in the foreground.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Jones’ plan was sound and well executed.
The advantage of having in
place a fresh tactical unit with integrated
supporting arms was immediately
obvious. Landing Team
1/6 made rapid progress along the
south coast, killing about 250
Japanese defenders and reaching the
thin lines held by 2/2 and 1/2 within
three hours. American casualties to
this point were light.</p>

<p>At 1100, Shoup called Jones to his
CP to receive the afternoon plan of
action. Jones’ executive officer, Major
Francis X. Beamer, took the occasion
to replace the lead rifle company.
Resistance was stiffening, the company
commander had just been shot by
a sniper, and the oppressive heat was
beginning to take a toll. Beamer
made superhuman efforts to get more
water and salt tablets for his men,
but several troops had already become
victims of heat prostration. According
to First Sergeant Lewis J.
Michelony, Tarawa’s sands were “as
white as snow and as hot as red-white
ashes from a heated furnace.”</p>

<p>Back on Green Beach, now 800
yards behind LT 1/6, McLeod’s LT
3/6 began streaming ashore. The
landing was uncontested but
nevertheless took several hours to execute.
It was not until 1100, the same
time that Jones’ leading elements
linked up with the 2d Marines, before
3/6 was fully established ashore.</p>

<p>The attack order for the 8th Marines
was the same as the previous
day: assault the strongpoints to the
east. The obstacles were just as
daunting on D+2. Three fortifications
were especially formidable: a steel pillbox
near the contested Burns-Philp
pier; a coconut log emplacement with
multiple machine guns; and a large
bombproof shelter further inland. All
three had been designed by Admiral
Saichiro, the master engineer, to be
mutually supported by fire and observation.
And notwithstanding Major
Crowe’s fighting spirit, these strongpoints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
had effectively contained the
combined forces of 2/8 and 3/8 since
the morning of D-Day.</p>

to land intact on Betio. The advance of
1/6 eastward on D+2 helped break the
back of Japanese resistance, as did the
unit’s repulse of the Japanese counterattack
that night. Jones’ sustained combat
leadership on Betio resulted in a battlefield
promotion to lieutenant colonel.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On the third day, Crowe reorganized
his tired forces for yet another assault.
First, the former marksmanship instructor
obtained cans of lubricating
oil and made his troops field strip and
clean their Garands before the attack.
Crowe placed his battalion executive
officer, Major William C. Chamberlin,
in the center of the three attacking
companies. Chamberlin, a former college
economics professor, was no less
dynamic than his red-mustached commander.
Though nursing a painful
wound in his shoulder from D-Day,
Chamberlin was a driving force in the
repetitive assaults against the three
strongpoints. Staff Sergeant Hatch
recalled that the executive officer was
“a wild man, a guy anybody would be
willing to follow.”</p>

<p>At 0930, a mortar crew under
Chamberlin’s direction got a direct hit
on the top of the coconut log emplacement
which penetrated the bunker
and detonated the ammunition stocks.
It was a stroke of immense good fortune
for the Marines. At the same
time, the medium tank “Colorado”
maneuvered close enough to the steel
pillbox to penetrate it with direct
75 mm fire. Suddenly, two of the three
emplacements were overrun.</p>

</div>


<p>The massive bombproof shelter,
however, was still lethal. Improvised
flanking attacks were shot to pieces before
they could gather momentum.
The only solution was to somehow gain
the top of the sand-covered mound
and drop explosives or thermite
grenades down the air vents to force
the defenders outside. This tough assignment
went to Major Chamberlin
and a squad of combat engineers under
First Lieutenant Alexander Bonnyman.
While riflemen and machine
gunners opened a rain of fire against
the strongpoint’s firing ports, this
small band raced across the sands and
up the steep slope. The Japanese knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
they were in grave danger. Scores of
them poured out of a rear entrance to
attack the Marines on top. Bonnyman
stepped forward, emptied his
flamethrower into the onrushing
Japanese, then charged them with a
carbine. He was shot dead, his body
rolling down the slope, but his men
were inspired to overcome the Japanese
counterattack. The surviving engineers
rushed to place explosives against the
rear entrances. Suddenly, several
hundred demoralized Japanese broke
out of the shelter in panic, trying to
flee eastward. The Marines shot them
down by the dozens, and the tank crew
fired a single “dream shot” canister
round which dispatched at least 20
more.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonnyman’s gallantry
resulted in a posthumous Medal of
Honor, the third to be awarded to Marines
on Betio. His sacrifice almost
single-handedly ended the stalemate
on Red Beach Three. Nor is it coincidence
that two of these highest awards
were received by combat engineers.
The performances of Staff Sergeant
Bordelon on D-Day and Lieutenant
Bonnyman on D+2 were representative
of hundreds of other engineers
on only a slightly less spectacular basis.
As an example, nearly a third of
the engineers who landed in support
of LT 2/8 became casualties. According
to Second Lieutenant Beryl W.
Rentel, the survivors used “eight cases
of TNT, eight cases of gelatin dynamite,
and two 54-pound blocks of
TNT” to demolish Japanese fortifications.
Rentel reported that his engineers
used both large blocks of
TNT and an entire case of dynamite
on the large bombproof shelter
alone.</p>

<p>At some point during the confused,
violent fighting in the 8th Marines’
zone&mdash;and unknown to the
Marines&mdash;Admiral Shibasaki died in
his blockhouse. The tenacious
Japanese commander’s failure to provide
backup communications to the
above-ground wires destroyed during
D-Day’s preliminary bombardment
had effectively kept him from
influencing the battle. Japanese archives
indicate Shibasaki was able to
transmit one final message to General
Headquarters in Tokyo early on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
D+2: “Our weapons have been destroyed

<p>Admiral Shibasaki’s counterpart,
General Julian Smith, landed on
Green Beach shortly before noon.
Smith observed the deployment of
McLeod’s LT 3/6 inland and conferred
with Major Ryan. But Smith
soon realized he was far removed
from the main action towards the
center of the island. He led his group
back across the reef to its landing
craft and ordered the coxswain to
make for the pier. At this point the
commanding general received a rude
introduction to the facts of life on Betio.
Although the Japanese strongpoints
at the re-entrant were being
hotly besieged by Hays’ 1/8, the
defenders still held mastery over the
approaches to Red Beaches One and
Two. Well-aimed machine gun fire
disabled the boat and killed the coxswain;
the other occupants had to
leap over the far gunwale into the
water. Major Tompkins, ever the
right man in the right place, then
waded through intermittent fire for
half a mile to find an LVT for the
general. Even this was not an altogether
safe exchange. The LVT
drew further fire, which wounded the
driver and further alarmed the occupants.
General Smith did not reach
Edson and Shoup’s combined CP until
nearly 1400.</p>

<p>“Red Mike” Edson in the meantime
had assembled his major subordinate
commanders and issued orders for
continuing the attack to the east that
afternoon. Major Jones’ 1/6 would
continue along the narrowing south
coast, supported by the pack howitzers
of 1/10 and all available tanks.
Colonel Hall’s two battalions of the
8th Marines would continue their advance
along the north coast. Jump-off
time was 1330. Naval gunfire and
air support would blast the areas for
an hour in advance.</p>

<p>Colonel Hall spoke up on behalf
of his exhausted, decimated landing
teams, ashore and in direct contact
since D-Day morning. The two landing
teams had enough strength for
one more assault, he told Edson, but
then they must get relief. Edson
promised to exchange the remnants
of 2/8 and 3/8 with Murray’s fresh
2/6 on Bairiki at the first opportunity
after the assault.</p>

<p>Jones returned to his troops in his
borrowed tank and issued the necessary
orders. Landing Team 1/6 continued
the attack at 1330, passing
through Kyle’s lines in the process.
Immediately it ran into heavy opposition.
The deadliest fire came from
heavy weapons mounted in a turret-type
emplacement near the south
beach. This took 90 minutes to overcome.
The light tanks were brave but
ineffective. Neutralization took sustained
75mm fire from one of the
Sherman medium tanks. Resistance
was fierce throughout Jones’ zone,
and his casualties began to mount.
The team had conquered 800 yards
of enemy territory fairly easily in the
morning, but could attain barely half
that distance in the long afternoon.</p>

<p>The 8th Marines, having finally
destroyed the three-bunker nemesis,
made good progress at first, but then
ran out of steam past the eastern end
of the airfield. Shoup had been right
the night before. The Japanese
defenders may have been leaderless,
but they still had an abundance of
bullets and esprit left. Major Crowe
pulled his leading elements back into
defensive positions for the night.
Jones halted, too, and placed one
company north of the airfield for a
direct link with Crowe. The end of
the airstrip was unmanned but covered
by fire.</p>

<p>On nearby Bairiki, all of 2/10 was
now in position and firing artillery
missions in support of Crowe and
Jones. Company B of the 2d Medical
Battalion established a field
hospital to handle the overflow of
casualties from <i>Doyen</i>. Murray’s 2/6,
eager to enter the fray, waited in vain
for boats to arrive to move them to
Green Beach. Very few landing craft
were available; many were crammed
with miscellaneous supplies as the
transports and cargo ships continued
general unloading, regardless of the
needs of the troops ashore. On Betio,
Navy Seabees were already at
work repairing the airstrip with bulldozers
and graders despite enemy
fire. From time to time, the Marines
would call for help in sealing a
bothersome bunker, and a bulldozer
would arrive to do the job nicely.
Navy beachmasters and shore party
Marines on the pier continued to
keep the supplies coming in, the
wounded going out. At 1550, Edson
requested a working party “to clear
bodies around pier ... hindering
shore party operations.” Late in the
day the first jeep got ashore, a wild
ride along the pier with every remaining
Japanese sniper trying to
take out the driver. Sherrod commented,
“If a sign of certain victory
were needed, this is it. The jeeps have
arrived.”</p>

<p>The strain of the prolonged battle
began to take effect. Colonel Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
reported that one of his Navajo Indian
code-talkers had been mistaken
for a Japanese and shot. A derelict,
blackened LVT drifted ashore, filled
with dead Marines. At the bottom of
the pile was one who was still breathing,
somehow, after two and a half
days of unrelenting hell. “Water,” he
gasped, “Pour some water on my
face, will you?”</p>

<p>Smith, Edson, and Shoup were
near exhaustion themselves. Relatively
speaking, the third day on Betio
had been one of spectacular gains,
but progress overall was maddeningly
slow, nor was the end yet in sight.
At 1600, General Smith sent this pessimistic
report to General Hermle,
who had taken his place on the
flagship:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Situation not favorable for
rapid clean-up of Betio. Heavy
casualties among officers make
leadership problems difficult.
Still strong resistance....
Many emplacements intact on
eastern end of the island....
In addition, many Japanese
strongpoints to westward of
our front lines within our position
that have not been reduced.
Progress slow and extremely
costly. Complete occupation
will take at least 5 days more.
Naval and air bombardment a
great help but does not take out
emplacements.</p></blockquote>

<p>General Smith assumed command
of operations ashore at 1930. By that
time he had about 7,000 Marines
ashore, struggling against perhaps
1,000 Japanese defenders. Updated
aerial photographs revealed many
defensive positions still intact
throughout much of Betio’s eastern
tail. Smith and Edson believed they
would need the entire 6th Marines to
complete the job. When Colonel Holmes
landed with the 6th Marines
headquarters group, Smith told him
to take command of his three landing
teams by 2100. Smith then called
a meeting of his commanders to assign
orders for D+3.</p>

<p>Smith directed Holmes to have
McLeod’s 3/6 pass through the lines
of Jones’ 1/6 in order to have a fresh
battalion lead the assault eastward.
Murray’s 2/6 would land on Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Beach and proceed east in support of
McLeod. All available tanks would
be assigned to McLeod (when Major
Jones protested that he had promised
to return the two Shermans loaned
by Major Ryan, Shoup told him
“with crisp expletives” what he could
do with his promise). Shoup’s 2d Marines,
with 1/8 still attached, would
continue to reduce the re-entrant
strongpoints. The balance of the 8th
Marines would be shuttled to Bairiki.
And the 4th Battalion, 10th Marines
would land its “heavy” 105mm guns
on Green Beach to augment the fires
of the two pack howitzer battalions
already in action. Many of these
plans were overcome by events of the
evening.</p>

<p>The major catalyst that altered
Smith’s plans was a series of vicious
Japanese counterattacks during the
night of D+2/D+3. As Edson put it,
the Japanese obligingly “gave us very
able assistance by trying to counterattack.”
The end result was a dramatic
change in the combat ratio
between attackers and survivors the
next day.</p>

<p>Major Jones sensed his exposed
forces would be the likely target for
any <i>Banzai</i> attack and took precautions.
Gathering his artillery forward
observers and naval fire control spotters,
Jones arranged for field artillery
support starting 75 yards from his
front lines to a point 500 yards out,
where naval gunfire would take over.
He placed Company A on the left,
next to the airstrip, and Company B
on the right, next to the south shore.
He worried about the 150-yard gap
across the runway to Company C,
but that could not be helped. Jones
used a tank to bring a stockpile of
grenades, small arms ammunition,
and water to be positioned 50 yards
behind the lines.</p>

<p>The first counterattack came at
1930. A force of 50 Japanese infiltrated
past Jones’ outposts in the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
vegetation and penetrated the border
between the two companies south of
the airstrip. Jones’ reserve force, comprised
of “my mortar platoon and my
headquarters cooks and bakers and
admin people,” contained the penetration
and killed the enemy in two
hours of close-in fighting under the
leadership of First Lieutenant Lyle
“Spook” Specht. An intense fire from
the pack howitzers of 1/10 and 2/10
prevented the Japanese from reinforcing
the penetration. By 2130 the lines
were stabilized. Jones asked Major
Kyle for a company to be positioned
100 yards to the rear of his lines. The
best Kyle could provide was a composite
force of 40 troops from the 2d
Marines.</p>

<p>The Japanese struck Jones’ lines
again at 2300. One force made a
noisy demonstration across from
Company A’s lines&mdash;taunting, clinking
canteens against their helmets,
yelling <i>Banzai!</i>&mdash;while a second force
attacked Company B with a silent
rush. The Marines repulsed this attack,
too, but were forced to use their
machine guns, thereby revealing their
positions. Jones asked McLeod for a
full company from 3/6 to reinforce
the 2d Marines to the rear of the
fighting.</p>

<p>A third attack came at 0300 in the
morning when the Japanese moved
several 7.7mm machine guns into
nearby wrecked trucks and opened
fire on the Marine automatic
weapons positions. Marine NCOs
volunteered to crawl forward against
this oncoming fire and lob grenades
into the improvised machine gun
nests. This did the job, and the battlefield
grew silent again. Jones called
for star shell illumination from the
destroyers in the lagoon.</p>

<p>At 0400, a force of some 300
Japanese launched a frenzied attack
against the same two companies. The
Marines met them with every available
weapon. Artillery fire from 10th
Marines howitzers on Red Beach Two
and Bairiki Island rained a murderous
crossfire. Two destroyers in the
lagoon, <i>Schroeder</i> (DD 301) and
<i>Sigsbee</i> (DD 502), opened up on the
flanks. The wave of screaming attackers
took hideous casualties but
kept coming. Pockets of men locked
together in bloody hand-to-hand
fighting. Private Jack Stambaugh of
B Company killed three screaming
Japanese with his bayonet; an officer
impaled him with his samurai sword;
another Marine brained the officer
with a rifle butt. First Lieutenant
Norman K. Thomas, acting commander
of Company B, reached
Major Jones on the field phone, exclaiming
“We’re killing them as fast
as they come at us, but we can’t hold
out much longer; we need reinforcements!”
Jones’ reply was tough, “We
haven’t got them; you’ve <i>got</i> to hold!”</p>

<p>Jones’ Marines lost 40 dead and
100 wounded in the wild fighting,
but hold they did. In an hour it was
all over. The supporting arms never
stopped shooting down the Japanese,
attacking or retreating. Both destroyers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
emptied their magazines of 5-inch
shells. The 1st Battalion, 10th Marines
fired 1,300 rounds that long
night, many shells being unloaded
over the pier while the fire missions
were underway. At first light, the
Marines counted 200 dead Japanese
within 50 yards of their lines, plus an
additional 125 bodies beyond that
range, badly mangled by artillery or
naval gunfire. Other bodies lay scattered
throughout the Marine lines.
Major Jones had to blink back tears
of pride and grief as he walked his
lines that dawn. Several of his Marines
grabbed his arm and muttered,
“They told us we had to hold, and by
God, we held.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Completing_the_Task" id="Completing_the_Task"></a><i>Completing the Task:<br />
23&ndash;28 November 1943</i></h2>


<p>“This was not only worse than
Guadalcanal,” admitted Lieutenant
Colonel Carlson, “It was the damnedest
fight I’ve seen in 30 years of
this business.”</p>

<p>The costly counterattacks during
the night of 22&ndash;23 November effectively
broke the back of the Japanese
defense. Had they remained in their
bunkers until the bitter end, the
defenders probably would have exacted
a higher toll in American lives.
Facing inevitable defeat in detail,
however, nearly 600 Japanese chose
to die by taking the offensive during
the night action.</p>

<p>The 2d Marine Division still had
five more hours of hard fighting on
Betio the morning of D+3 before the
island could be conquered. Late in
the morning, General Smith sent this
report to Admiral Hill on <i>Maryland</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Decisive defeat of enemy
counterattack last night destroyed
bulk of hostile
resistance. Expect complete annihilation
of enemy on Betio
this date. Strongly recommend
that you and your chief of staff
come ashore this date to get information
about the type of
hostile resistance which will be
encountered in future operations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, following a systematic
preliminary bombardment, the fresh
troops of McLeod’s LT 3/6 passed
through Jones’ lines and commenced
their attack to the east. By now, Marine
assault tactics were well refined.
Led by tanks and combat engineers
with flamethrowers and high explosives,
the troops of 3/6 made rapid
progress. Only one bunker, a well-armed
complex along the north
shore, provided effective opposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
McLeod took advantage of the heavy
brush along the south shore to
bypass the obstacle, leaving one rifle
company to encircle and eventually
overrun it. Momentum was
maintained; the remaining Japanese
seemed dispirited. By 1300, McLeod
reached the eastern tip of Betio, having
inflicted more than 450 Japanese
casualties at the loss of 34 of his Marines.
McLeod’s report summarized
the general collapse of the Japanese
defensive system in the eastern zone
following the counterattacks: “At no
time was there any determined defensive....
We used flamethrowers and
could have used more. Medium tanks
were excellent. My light tanks didn’t
fire a shot.”</p>

<p>The toughest fight of the fourth
day occurred on the Red Beach
One/Two border where Colonel
Shoup directed the combined forces
of Hays’ 1/8 and Schoettel’s 3/2
against the “re-entrant” strongpoints.
The Japanese defenders in these positions
were clearly the most
disciplined&mdash;and the deadliest&mdash;on
the island. From these bunkers,
Japanese antiboat gunners had
thoroughly disrupted the landings of
four different battalions, and they
had very nearly killed General Smith
the day before. The seaward approaches
to these strongpoints were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
littered with wrecked LVTs and bloated
bodies.</p>

  <div class="captionl">

<p><i>A Marine throws a hand grenade during the battle for the interior of the island.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Major Hays finally got some
flamethrowers (from Crowe’s engineers
when LT 2/8 was ordered to
stand down), and the attack of 1/8
from the east made steady, if painstaking,
progress. Major Schoettel,
anxious to atone for what some perceived
to be a lackluster effort on D-Day,
pressed the assault of 3/2 from
the west and south. To complete the
circle, Shoup ordered a platoon of infantry
and a pair of 75mm halftracks
out to the reef to keep the defenders
pinned down from the lagoon. Some
of the Japanese committed <i>hara-kiri</i>;
the remainder, exhausted, fought to
the end. Hays’ Marines had been attacking
this complex ever since their
bloody landing on the morning of
D+1. In those 48 hours, 1/8 fired
54,450 rounds of .30-caliber rifle ammunition.
But the real damage was
done by the special weapons of the
engineers and the direct fire of the
halftracks. Capture of the largest position,
a concrete pillbox near the
beach, enabled easier approaches to
the remaining bunkers. By 1300, it
was all over.</p>

<p>At high noon, while the fighting
in both sectors was still underway, a
Navy fighter plane landed on Betio’s
airstrip, weaving around the Seabee
trucks and graders. Nearby Marines
swarmed over the plane to shake the
pilot’s hand. A PB2Y also landed to
take out press reports and the haggard
observers, including Evans Carlson
and Walter Jordan.</p>

MORNING OF NOV. 23, 1943</span></p>
<p class="small">TAKEN FROM 2D MAR DIV
   SPECIAL ACTION REPORT</p></div></div>

<p>Admiral Hill and his staff came
ashore at 1245. The naval officers
marveled at the great strength of the
Japanese bunker system, realizing immediately
the need to reconsider their
preliminary bombardment policies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Admiral Hill called Betio “a little
Gibraltar,” and observed that “only
the Marines could have made such
a landing.”</p>

<p>When Smith received the nearly
simultaneous reports from Colonels
Shoup and Holmes that both final
objectives had been seized, he was
able to share the good news with Hill.
The two had worked together harmoniously
to achieve this victory. Between
them, they drafted a message
to Admiral Turner and General Holland
Smith announcing the end of
organized resistance on Betio. It was
1305, about 76 hours after PFC
Moore first rammed LVT 4-9 (“My
Deloris”) onto the seawall on Red
Beach One to begin the direct assault.</p>

<p>The stench of death and decay was
overwhelming. “Betio would be more
habitable,” reported Robert Sherrod,
“if the Marines could leave for a few
days and send a million buzzards in.”
Working parties sought doggedly to
identify the dead; often the bodies
were so badly shattered or burned as
to eliminate distinction between
friend and foe. Chaplains worked
alongside burial teams equipped with
bulldozers. General Smith’s administrative
staff worked hard to prepare
accurate casualty lists. More casualties
were expected in the mop-up
operations in the surrounding islands
and Apamama. Particularly distressing
was the report that nearly 100 enlisted
Marines were missing and
presumed dead. The changing tides
had swept many bodies of the assault
troops out to sea. The first pilot
ashore reported seeing scores of floating
corpses, miles away, over the
horizon.</p>

<p>The Japanese garrison was nearly
annihilated in the fighting. The Marines,
supported by naval gunfire,
carrier aviation, and Army Air Force
units, killed 97 percent of the 4,836
troops estimated to be on Betio during
the assault. Only 146 prisoners
were taken, all but 17 of them
Korean laborers. The Marines captured
only one Japanese officer,
30-year-old Kiyoshi Ota from
Nagasaki, a Special Duty Ensign in
the <i>7th Sasebo Special Landing Force</i>.
Ensign Ota told his captors the garrison
expected the landings along the
south and southwest sectors instead
of the northern beaches. He also
thought the reef would protect the
defenders throughout periods of low
tide.</p>

<p>Shortly before General Julian
Smith’s announcement of victory at
Betio, his Army counterpart, General
Ralph Smith, signalled “Makin
taken!” In three days of sharp fighting
on Butaritari Island, the Army
wiped out the Japanese garrison at
the cost of 200 American casualties.
Bad blood developed between
“Howling Mad” Smith and Ralph
Smith over the conduct of this operation
which would have unfortunate
consequences in a later amphibious
campaign.</p>

<p>The grimy Marines on Betio took
a deep breath and sank to the
ground. Many had been awake since
the night before the landing. As Captain
Carl Hoffman recalled, “There
was just no way to rest; there was virtually
no way to eat. Mostly it was
close, hand-to-hand fighting and survival
for three and a half days. It
seemed like the longest period of my
life.” Lieutenant Lillibridge had no
nourishment at all until the afternoon
of D+3. “One of my men
mixed up a canteen cup full of hot
water, chocolate, coffee, and sugar,
and gave it to me, saying he thought
I needed something. It was the best
meal I ever had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>The Marines stared numbly at the
desolation that surrounded them.
Lieutenant Colonel Russell Lloyd, executive
officer of the 6th Marines,
took a minute to scratch out a hasty
note to his wife, saying “I’m on Tarawa
in the midst of the worst destruction
I’ve ever seen.” Chaplain Willard
walked along Red Beach One, finally
clear of enemy pillboxes. “Along
the shore,” he wrote, “I counted the
bodies of 76 Marines staring up at
me, half in, half out of the water.”
Robert Sherrod also took the opportunity
to walk about the island.
“What I saw on Betio was, I am certain,
one of the greatest works of
devastation wrought by man.” Sherrod
whistled at the proliferation of
heavy machine guns and 77mm antiboat
guns along the northwest
shore. As he described one scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Amtrack Number 4-8 is
jammed against the seawall barricade.
Three waterlogged Marines
lie beneath it. Four others
are scattered nearby, and there
is one hanging on a two-foot-high
strand of barbed wire who
does not touch the coral flat at
all. Back of the 77mm gun are
many hundreds of rounds of
77mm ammunition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other Japanese forces in the Gilberts
exacted a high toll among the
invasion force. Six Japanese submarines
reached the area during D+2.
One of these, the <i>I-175</i>, torpedoed
the escort carrier <i>Liscome Bay</i> just
before sunrise on 24 November off
Makin. The explosion was terrific&mdash;Admiral
Hill saw the flash at Tarawa,
93 miles away&mdash;and the ship
sank quickly, taking 644 souls to the
bottom.</p>

<p>The Marines on Betio conducted
a joint flag-raising ceremony later
that same morning. Two of the few
surviving palm trees were selected as
poles, but the Marines were hard put
to find a British flag. Finally, Major
Holland, the New Zealand officer
who had proved so prophetic about
the tides at Tarawa, produced a Union
Jack. A field musician played the
appropriate bugle calls; Marines all
over the small island stood and saluted.
Each could reckon the cost.</p>

<p>At this time came the good news
from Captain James Jones (brother
to Major “Willie K.” Jones) at Apamama.
Jones’ V Amphibious Corps
Reconnaissance Company had landed
by rubber rafts from the transport
submarine <i>Nautilus</i> during the night
of 20&ndash;21 November. The small
Japanese garrison at first kept the
scouts at bay. The <i>Nautilus</i> then surfaced
and bombarded the Japanese
positions with deck guns. This killed
some of the defenders; the remainder
committed <i>hara-kiri</i>. The island was
deemed secure by the 24th. General
Julian Smith sent General Hermle
and McLeod’s LT 3/6 to take command
of Apamama until base
defense forces could arrive.</p>

<p>General Smith kept his promise to
his assault troops at Tarawa. Amphibious
transports entered the lagoon
on 24 November and
backloaded Combat Teams 2 and 8.
To Lieutenant Lillibridge, going back
on board ship after Betio was like going
to heaven. “The Navy personnel
were unbelievably generous and kind
... we were treated to a full-scale turkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
dinner.... The Navy officers
helped serve the food.” But Lillibridge,
like many other surviving
troop leaders, suffered from post-combat
trauma. The lieutenant had
lost over half the members of his platoon,
and he was consumed with
guilt.</p>

<p>With the 2d Marines and 8th Marines
off to Hawaii, McLeod’s 3/6 enroute
to Apamama, and Murray’s
2/6 beginning its long trek through
the other islands of the Tarawa Atoll,
Major Jones’ 1/6 became the last infantry
unit on Betio. Its work was
tedious: burying the dead, flushing
out die-hard snipers, hosting visiting
dignitaries.</p>

<p>The first of these was Major
General Holland Smith. The V Amphibious
Corps Commander flew to
Betio on 24 November and spent an
emotional afternoon viewing the carnage
with Julian Smith. “Howling
Mad” Smith was shaken by the experience.
In his words: “The sight of
our dead floating in the waters of the
lagoon and lying along the blood-soaked
beaches is one I will never
forget. Over the pitted, blasted island
hung a miasma of coral dust and
death, nauseating and horrifying.”</p>

<p>Major Jones recalled that Holland
Smith had tears in his eyes as he
walked through the ruins. Robert
Sherrod also accompanied the generals.
They came upon one sight that
moved all of them to tears. It was a
dead Marine, leaning forward
against the seawall, “one arm still
supported upright by the weight of
his body. On top of the seawall, just
beyond his upraised hand, lies a blue
and white flag, a beach marker to tell
succeeding waves where to land.”
Holland Smith cleared his throat and
said, “How can men like that ever be
defeated?”</p>

<p>Company D, 2d Tank Battalion,
was designated as the scout company
for the 2d Marine Division for the
Tarawa operation. Small elements of
these scouts landed on Eita and Buota
Islands while the fighting on Betio
still raged, discovering and
shadowing a sizeable Japanese force.
On 23 November, Lieutenant
Colonel Manley Curry’s 3d Battalion,
10th Marines, landed on Eita. The
battalion’s pack howitzers were initially
intended to augment fires on
Betio; when that island finally fell,
the artillerymen turned their guns to
support the 2d Battalion, 6th Marines,
in clearing the rest of the islands
in the atoll.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray’s LT
2/6 boarded boats from Betio at 0500
on 24 November and landed on Buota.
Murray set a fierce pace, the Marines
frequently wading across the
sandspits that joined the succeeding
islands. Soon he was out of range of
Curry’s guns on Eita. Curry detached
Battery G to follow Murray in trace.
The Marines learned from friendly
natives that a Japanese force of about
175 naval infantry was ahead on the
larger island of Buariki, near the
northwest point of the atoll. Murray’s
lead elements caught up with the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
at dusk on 26 November. There
was a sharp exchange of fire in very
thick vegetation before both sides
broke contact. Murray positioned his
forces for an all-out assault in the
morning.</p>

<p>The battle of Buariki on 27
November was the last engagement
in the Gilberts, and it was just as
deadly as each preceding encounter
with the <i>Special Naval Landing
Forces</i>. Murray attacked the Japanese
defensive positions at first light, getting
one salvo of supporting fire from
Battery G before the lines became too
intermingled in the extended melee.
Here the fighting was similar to
Guadalcanal: much hand-to-hand
brawling in tangled underbrush. The
Japanese had no elaborate defenses
as on Betio, but the Imperial sea soldiers
took advantage of cover and concealment,
made every shot count,
and fought to the last man. All 175
were slain. Murray’s victory was
dearly bought: 32 officers and men
killed, 59 others wounded. The following
day, the Marines crossed to
the last remaining islet. There were
no more Japanese to be found. On
28 November, Julian Smith announced
“remaining enemy forces on
Tarawa wiped out.”</p>

<p>Admirals Nimitz and Spruance
came to Betio just before Julian
Smith’s announcement. Nimitz
quickly saw that the basic Japanese
defenses were still intact. He directed
his staff to diagnose the exact construction
methods used; within a
month an identical set of bunkers and
pillboxes was being built on the naval
bombardment island of Kahoolawe
in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>Admiral Nimitz paused to present
the first of many combat awards to
Marines of the 2d Marine Division.
In time, other recognition followed.
The entire division was awarded the
Presidential Unit Citation. Colonel
David Monroe Shoup received the
Medal of Honor. Major “Jim” Crowe
and his executive officer, Major Bill
Chamberlin, received the Navy
Cross. So did Lieutenant Colonel
Herb Amey (posthumously), Major
Mike Ryan, and Corporal John Spillane,
the LVT crewchief and prospective
baseball star who caught the
Japanese hand grenades in mid-air on
D-Day before his luck ran out.</p>

<p>Some of the senior officers in the
division were jealous of Shoup’s Medal
of Honor, but Julian Smith knew
full well whose strong shoulders had
borne the critical first 36 hours of the
assault. Shoup was philosophical. As
he recorded in his combat notebook,
“With God and the U.S. Navy in
direct support of the 2d MarDiv
there was never any doubt that we
would get Betio. For several hours,
however, there was considerable haggling
over the exact price we were to
pay for it.”</p>

<h3 title="Incident on D+3" class="nobreak p0 black">Incident on D+3</h3>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A</span> small incident on the last day of the fighting on
Betio cost First Sergeant Lewis J. Michelony, Jr.
his sense of smell. Michelony, a member of the
1st Battalion, 6th Marines, was a former boxing champion
of the Atlantic Fleet and a combat veteran of Guadalcanal.
Later in the Pacific War he would receive two Silver
Star Medals for conspicuous bravery. On D+3 at Tarawa,
however, he very nearly lost his life.</p>

<p>First Sergeant Michelony accompanied two other Marines
on a routine reconnaissance of an area east of Green
Beach, looking for likely positions to assign the battalion
mortar platoon. The area had been “cleared” by the infantry
companies of the battalion the previous morning. Other
Marines had passed through the complex of seemingly empty
Japanese bunkers without incident. The clearing was littered
with Japanese bodies and abandoned enemy
equipment. The three Marines threw grenades into the first
bunker they encountered without response. All was quiet.</p>

<p>“Suddenly, out of nowhere, all hell broke loose,” recalled
Michelony. “The front bunker opened fire with a machine
gun, grenades hailed in from nowhere.” One Marine died
instantly; the second escaped, leaving Michelony face down
in the sand. In desperation, the first sergeant dove into the
nearest bunker, tumbling through a rear entrance to land
in what he thought was a pool of water. In the bunker’s
dim light, he discovered it was a combination of water,
urine, blood, and other material, “some of it from the bodies
of the dead Japanese and some from the live ones.” As
he spat out the foul liquid from his mouth, Michelony realized
there were live Japanese in among the dead, decaying
ones. The smell, taste, and fear he experienced inside the
bunker were almost overpowering. “Somehow I managed
to get out. To this day, I don’t know how. I crawled out
of this cesspool dripping wet.” The scorching sun dried his
utilities as though they had been heavily starched; they still
stank. “For months after, I could taste and smell, as well
as visualize, this scene.” Fifty years after the incident, retired
Sergeant Major Michelony still has no sense of smell.

<h2><a name="The_Significance_of_Tarawa" id="The_Significance_of_Tarawa"></a><i>The Significance of Tarawa</i></h2>


<p>The costs of the forcible seizure of
Tarawa were two-fold: the loss of
Marines in the assault itself, followed
by the shock and despair of the nation
upon hearing the reports of the
battle. The gains at first seemed small
in return, the “stinking little island”
of Betio, 8,000 miles from Tokyo. In
time, the practical lessons learned in
the complex art of amphibious assault
began to outweigh the initial
adverse publicity.</p>

<p>The final casualty figures for the
2d Marine Division in Operation
Galvanic were 997 Marines and 30
sailors (organic medical personnel)
dead; 88 Marines missing and presumed
dead; and 2,233 Marines and
59 sailors wounded. Total casualties:
3,407. The Guadalcanal campaign
had cost a comparable amount of
Marine casualties over six months;
Tarawa’s losses occurred in a period
of 76 hours. Moreover, the ratio of
killed to wounded at Tarawa was significantly
high, reflecting the
savagery of the fighting. The overall
proportion of casualties among those
Marines engaged in the assault was
about 19 percent, a steep but “acceptable”
price. But some battalions
suffered much higher losses. The 2d
Amphibian Tractor Battalion lost
over half the command. The battalion
also lost all but 35 of the 125
LVT’s employed at Betio.</p>

<p>Lurid headlines&mdash;“The Bloody
Beaches of Tarawa”&mdash;alarmed American
newspaper readers. Part of this
was the Marines’ own doing. Many
of the combat correspondents invited
along for Operation Galvanic had
shared the very worst of the hell of
Betio the first 36 hours, and they simply
reported what they observed.
Such was the case of Marine Corps
Master Technical Sergeant James C.
Lucas, whose accounts of the fighting
received front-page coverage in
both <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The
New York Times</i> on 4 December
1943. Colonel Shoup was furious
with Lucas for years thereafter, but
it was the headline writers for both
papers who did the most damage
(<i>The Times</i>: “Grim Tarawa Defense
a Surprise, Eyewitness of Battle Reveals;
Marines Went in Chuckling, To
Find Swift Death Instead of Easy
Conquest.”).</p>

<p>Nor did extemporaneous remarks
to the media by some of the senior
Marines involved in Operation Galvanic
help soothe public concerns.
Holland Smith likened the D-Day assault
to Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg.
“Red Mike” Edson said the
assault force “paid the stiffest price
in human life per square yard” at
Tarawa than any other engagement
in Marine Corps history. Evans Carlson
talked graphically of seeing 100
of Hays men gunned down in the
water in five minutes on D+1, a considerable
exaggeration. It did not
help matters when Headquarters Marine
Corps waited until 10 days after
the battle to release casualty lists.</p>

</div>


<p>The atmosphere in both Washington
and Pearl Harbor was particularly
tense during this period. General
MacArthur, still bitter that the 2d
Marine Division had been taken
from his Southwest Pacific Command,
wrote the Secretary of War
complaining that “these frontal attacks
by the Navy, as at Tarawa, are
a tragic and unnecessary massacre of
American lives.” A woman wrote Admiral
Nimitz accusing him of “murdering
my son.” Secretary of the
Navy Frank Knox called a press conference
in which he blamed “a sudden
shift in the wind” for exposing
the reef and preventing reinforcements
from landing. Congress proposed
a special investigation. The
Marines were fortunate to have
General Alexander A. Vandegrift in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Washington as the newly appointed
18th Commandant. Vandegrift, the
widely respected and highly decorated
veteran of Guadalcanal, quietly
reassured Congress, pointing out that
“Tarawa was an assault from beginning
to end.” The casualty reports
proved to be less dramatic than expected.
A thoughtful editorial in the
27 December 1943 issue of <i>The New
York Times</i> complimented the Marines
for overcoming Tarawa’s
sophisticated defenses and fanatical
garrison, warning that future assaults
in the Marshalls might result in heavier
losses. “We must steel ourselves
now to pay that price.”</p>

<p>The controversy was stirred again
after the war when General Holland
Smith claimed publicly that “Tarawa
was a mistake!” Significantly, Nimitz,
Spruance, Turner, Hill, Julian Smith,
and Shoup disagreed with that assessment.</p>

<p>Admiral Nimitz did not waver.
“The capture of Tarawa,” he stated,
“knocked down the front door to the
Japanese defenses in the Central Pacific.”
Nimitz launched the Marshalls
campaign only 10 weeks after the seizure
of Tarawa. Photo-reconnaissance
and attack aircraft from the
captured airfields at Betio and
Apamama provided invaluable support.
Of greater significance to success
in the Marshalls were the lessons
learned and the confidence gleaned
from the Tarawa experience.</p>

<p>Henry I. Shaw, Jr., for many years
the Chief Historian of the Marine
Corps, observed that Tarawa was the
primer, the textbook on amphibious
assault that guided and influenced all
subsequent landings in the Central
Pacific. Shaw believed that the
prompt and selfless analyses which
immediately followed Tarawa were
of great value: “From analytical
reports of the commanders and from
their critical evaluations of what
went wrong, of what needed improvement,
and of what techniques
and equipment proved out in combat,
came a tremendous outpouring
of lessons learned.”</p>

<p>All participants agreed that the
conversion of logistical LVTs to assault
craft made the difference between
victory and defeat at Betio.
There was further consensus that the
LVT-1s and LVT-2s employed in the
operation were marginal against
heavy defensive fires. The Alligators
needed more armor, heavier armament,
more powerful engines, auxiliary
bilge pumps, self-sealing gas
tanks&mdash;and wooden plugs the size of
13mm bullets to keep from being
sunk by the Japanese M93 heavy
machine guns. Most of all, there
needed to be many more LVTs, at
least 300 per division. Shoup wanted
to keep the use of LVTs as reef-crossing
assault vehicles a secret, but
there had been too many reporters on
the scene. Hanson W. Baldwin broke
the story in <i>The New York Times</i> as
early as 3 December.</p>

<p>Naval gunfire support got mixed
reviews. While the Marines were enthusiastic
about the response from
destroyers in the lagoon, they were
critical of the extent and accuracy of
the preliminary bombardment, especially
when it was terminated so
prematurely on D-Day. In Major
Ryan’s evaluation, the significant
shortcoming in Operation Galvanic
“lay in overestimating the damage
that could be inflicted on a heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
defended position by an intense but
limited naval bombardment, and by
not sending in the assault forces soon
enough after the shelling.” Major
Schoettel, recalling the pounding his
battalion had received from emplacements
within the seawall, recommended
direct fire against the face of
the beach by 40mm guns from close-in
destroyers. The hasty, saturation
fires, deemed sufficient by planners
in view of the requirement for strategic
surprise, proved essentially useless.
Amphibious assaults against
fortified atolls would most of all need
sustained, deliberate, aimed fire.</p>

<p>While no one questioned the bravery
of the aviators who supported the
Betio assault, many questioned
whether they were armed and trained
adequately for such a difficult target.
The need for closer integration of all
supporting arms was evident.</p>

<p>Communications throughout the
Betio assault were awful. Only the
ingenuity of a few radio operators
and the bravery of individual runners
kept the assault reasonably coherent.
The Marines needed waterproof radios.
The Navy needed a dedicated
amphibious command ship, not a
major combatant whose big guns
would knock out the radio nets with
each salvo. Such command ships, the
AGCs, began to appear during the
Marshalls campaign.</p>

<p>Other revisions to amphibious
doctrine were immediately indicated.
The nature and priority of unloading
supplies should henceforth become
the call of the tactical
commander ashore, not the amphibious
task force commander.</p>

<p>Betio showed the critical need for
underwater swimmers who could
stealthily assess and report reef,
beach, and surf conditions to the task
force before the landing. This concept,
first envisioned by amphibious
warfare prophet Major Earl “Pete” Ellis
in the 1920s, came quickly to fruition.
Admiral Turner had a fledgling
Underwater Demolition Team on
hand for the Marshalls.</p>

<p>The Marines believed that, with
proper combined arms training, the
new medium tanks would be valuable
assets. Future tank training would
emphasize integrated tank, infantry,
engineer, and artillery operations.
Tank-infantry communications needed
immediate improvement. Most
casualties among tank commanders
at Betio resulted from the individuals
having to dismount from their vehicles
to talk with the infantry in the
open.</p>

<p>The backpack flamethrower won
universal acclaim from the Marines
on Betio. Each battalion commander
recommended increases in quantity,
range, and mobility for these assault
weapons. Some suggested that larger
versions be mounted on tanks and
LVTs, presaging the appearance of
“Zippo Tanks” in later campaigns in
the Pacific.</p>

<p>Julian Smith rather humbly
summed up the lessons learned at
Tarawa by commenting, “We made
fewer mistakes than the Japs did.”</p>

<p>Military historians Jeter A. Isely
and Philip A. Crowl used different
words of assessment: “The capture of
Tarawa, in spite of defects in execution,
conclusively demonstrated that
American amphibious doctrine was
valid, that even the strongest island
fortress could be seized.”</p>

<p>The subsequent landings in the
Marshalls employed this doctrine, as
modified by the Tarawa experience,
to achieve objectives against similar
targets with fewer casualties and in
less time. The benefits of Operation
Galvanic quickly began to outweigh
the steep initial costs.</p>

<p>In time, Tarawa became a symbol
of raw courage and sacrifice on the
part of attackers and defenders alike.
Ten years after the battle, General
Julian Smith paid homage to both
sides in an essay in <i>Naval Institute
Proceedings</i>. He saluted the heroism
of the Japanese who chose to die
almost to the last man. Then he
turned to his beloved 2d Marine Division
and their shipmates in Task
Force 53 at Betio:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For the officers and men, Marines
and sailors, who crossed
that reef, either as assault
troops, or carrying supplies, or
evacuating wounded I can only
say that I shall forever think of
them with a feeling of reverence
and the greatest respect.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Themes underlying the enduring legacy of Tarawa are: the tide that failed; tactical

<h3 title="Tarawa Today" class="nobreak p0 black">Tarawa Today</h3>

<p class="drop-cap redcap"><span class="smcap1">Tarawa</span> is one of the few Pacific battlefields that remained
essentially unchanged for the half century
that followed World War II. Visitors to Betio Island
can readily see wrecked American tanks and LVTs
along the beaches, as well as the ruins of Japanese gun emplacements
and pill boxes. Admiral Shibasaki’s imposing
concrete bunker still stands, seemingly as impervious to
time as it was to the battleship guns of Task Force 53. The
“Singapore Guns” still rest in their turrets overlooking the
approaches to the island. A few years ago, natives unearthed
a buried LVT containing the skeletons of its Marine
Corps crew, one still wearing dog tags.</p>

<p>General David M. Shoup was recalled from retirement
to active duty for nine days in 1968 to represent the United
States at the dedication of a large monument on Betio,
commemorating the 25th anniversary of the battle. As
Shoup later told <i>The National Observer</i>, “My first reaction
was that Betio had shrunk a great deal. It seems smaller
in peace than in war.” As he toured the ruined fortifications,
Shoup recalled the savage, desperate fighting and wondered
“why two nations would spend so much for so little.” Nearly
6,000 Japanese and Americans died on the tiny island in
76 hours of fighting.</p>

<p>Twenty years after Shoup’s dedication ceremony, the
American memorial had fallen into disrepair; indeed, it was
in danger of being torn down to make room for a cold-storage
plant for Japanese fishermen. A lengthy campaign
by the 2d Marine Division Association and Long Beach-journalist
Tom Hennessy raised enough funds to obtain a
new, more durable monument, a nine-ton block of Georgia
granite inscribed “To our fellow Marines who gave
their all.” The memorial was dedicated on 20 November
1988.</p>

<p>Betio is now part of the new Republic of Kiribati. Tourist
facilities are being developed to accommodate the large
number of veterans who wish to return. For now, the small
island probably resembles the way it appeared on D-Day,
50 years ago. American author James Ramsey Ullman visited
Tarawa earlier and wrote a fitting eulogy: “It is a familiar
irony that old battlefields are often the quietest and gentlest
of places. It is true of Gettysburg. It is true of Cannae,
Chalons, Austerlitz, Verdun. And it is true of Tarawa.”</p>
